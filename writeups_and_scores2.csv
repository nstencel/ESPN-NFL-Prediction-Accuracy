" What to watch for: Nobody is really sure what to expect out of the Jaguars' offense under new coordinator John DeFilippo and quarterback Nick Foles. Can the Jags score 30-plus points? That's what it'll probably take to beat the Chiefs, who look just as potent as they were last season. -- Michael DiRocco Bold prediction: Patrick Mahomes will throw at least two touchdown passes. That might not sound like a big deal for a QB who threw 50 of them last season, but remember the Jaguars were the only team to shut him out in that category in the regular season last year. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Tyreek Hill scored on each of his first two touches of the 2018 season (against the Chargers), a 91-yard punt return and a 58-yard reception. He has a league-high 302 receiving yards in season openers over the past two years, but the Jaguars did limit him to only four receptions for 61 yards in Week 5 last season. What to know for fantasy: Mahomes posted the best fantasy season ever by a quarterback (417.1 points), but the Jags are the fourth-best defense against quarterbacks since Doug Marrone took over in 2016. Only once last season did a QB go into Jacksonville and score 21-plus points (Carson Wentz). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Foles has covered seven straight games as an underdog, including six outright wins. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Don't be surprised if Cam Newton tests his throwing shoulder early with at least two deep throws, probably to Curtis Samuel, to make the Rams play honest. He also won't be hesitant to run. He led the Panthers in rushing in last year's opener. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Todd Gurley will rush for more than 100 yards and will add a touchdown. He returns to the state where he grew up for the first time as a pro and is coming off arguably his most challenging offseason because of endless chatter about his left knee. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Jared Goff led the NFL with 116 completions of 10-plus air yards last season. The Panthers, meanwhile, gave up 16 passing touchdowns of at least 10 air yards in 2018, tied for the third most in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Wide receiver Cooper Kupp returns to action after tearing his ACL last season. Kupp caught at least five passes in six of eight games last season and is averaging 1.3 red zone targets per game during his career (seventh best). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Super Bowl losers from the previous season are 3-16 against the spread (ATS) in Week 1 the following season since 2000. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Julio Jones-Xavier Rhodes matchup is always popcorn-worthy. A healthy Rhodes limited Jones to two catches for 24 yards in 2017 during one of his best years as a pro. But he is coming off a season riddled with injuries. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Miami friends and former Florida State Seminoles Dalvin Cook and Devonta Freeman will each go for 100 rushing yards. But it's Cook and the Vikings who come up with the win. -- Vaughn McClure Stat to know: Matt Ryan's 4,924 passing yards were third in the NFL last season, but the Vikings gave up only 196.3 passing yards per game -- also third in NFL. What to know for fantasy: The Falcons have given up the most running-back receptions in each of the past four seasons, and Cook ranked seventh among running backs in receptions last December. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Mike Zimmer is 52-29-2 ATS as a head coach, the best mark by any coach in the Super Bowl era (minimum 50 games), including 29-12-1 at home. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The unveiling of the Baker Mayfield-Odell Beckham Jr. passing connection, which has a chance to be among the elite in the NFL, will be reason enough to tune in. How the duo fares in its debut will offer a glimpse of how dynamic this Browns offense can be in 2019. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: The Browns' offense is potent, but it will take time to get rolling in the season opener against a Titans defense that catches Cleveland at the perfect time. Derrick Henry runs for 125 yards and a touchdown. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: Henry led the NFL with 585 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns over the final four weeks of last season. That success came from his bruising running style, as he led the NFL with 2.85 yards after contact per rush. What to know for fantasy: Mayfield was the only quarterback to throw for three touchdowns in Week 16 and Week 17 last season. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Cleveland is 0-13-1 outright and 4-9-1 ATS in its past 14 Week 1 games, but it did cover each of its past two season openers. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Eagles are anticipating Washington cornerback Josh Norman will shadow Alshon Jeffery most of the game. That's all the more reason for Carson Wentz to target his other outside receiver, DeSean Jackson, who has a history of monster games against his former teams. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Tight ends will do most of the damage in this matchup. The Redskins' Jordan Reed will catch five passes for 70 yards and a touchdown, and Eagles tight end Zach Ertz will continue his domination of Washington with seven catches for 80 yards and a score of his own. -- John Keim Stat to know: The Eagles are 8-2 in their past 10 season openers, tied for the best season-opening record in the NFL (with the Broncos and Patriots) during that span. Meanwhile, the Redskins have lost five of their past six season openers. What to know for fantasy: Wentz was one of three quarterbacks to throw for 300 yards and multiple touchdowns against the Redskins last season. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Philadelphia is 5-1 ATS in its past six season openers, and Washington is 1-5 ATS in that same span. Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Jets running back Le'Veon Bell makes his much-anticipated return to the NFL after sitting out the 2018 season because of a contract dispute with the Steelers. And second-year QBs Sam Darnold and Josh Allen, who are close friends, meet for the second time in what figures to be a long personal rivalry within the AFC East. Darnold leads Allen 1-0. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: Devin Singletary will score two touchdowns. The rookie running back has a role on the ground and in the passing game, and will find his way into the end zone in both capacities Sunday. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: Allen averaged 10.5 air yards per attempt last season for Buffalo, the second-highest rate in the NFL -- but he completed just 37% of his throws more than 10 yards downfield, which was the worst mark in the league. What to know for fantasy: Bell was RB2 the last time we saw him (2017), averaging 22.8 points per game. And there were four running backs last season who scored over 25 points in a game against the Bills (Marlon Mack, Melvin Gordon, Leonard Fournette and James White). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The underdog has won five of the past six -- and nine of the past 11 -- meetings between these two teams outright. Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Dolphins coaches' eyes widened when Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson was mentioned this week, and they highlighted his passing game improvement from Year 1 to Year 2. ""This is not a one-trick pony,"" coach Brian Flores said. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: Jackson gains over 100 yards rushing. He's opening the season against a Dolphins defense that allowed Bills QB Josh Allen to rush for 135 and 95 yards in two meetings last December. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: The Ravens have scored 54 unanswered points versus the Dolphins, including a 40-0 win in Week 8 of 2017. And the Ravens went 6-1 after naming Jackson the starting quarterback in Week 10 of 2018. What to know for fantasy: Jackson ranked sixth in rush attempts and seventh in rushing yards over the final seven weeks of 2018 ... among all positions. Over that stretch, Jackson had more rushing yards (556) and rushing touchdowns (4) than Christian McCaffrey. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Baltimore has covered each of the past eight meetings. But Miami has covered six straight season openers, the longest active streak in the league. Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: With Andrew Luck's surprising retirement, how Jacoby Brissett plays in his absence will go a long way in determining the outcome. Head coach Frank Reich said Brissett just has to play within himself. ""The message is you don't have to be a hero,"" Reich said. -- Eric D. Williams Bold prediction: Running back Marlon Mack will rush for more than 100 yards. Mack rushed for 908 yards despite missing four games last season, and the Chargers gave up an average of 101.6 yards per game rushing last season and will be without starting Pro Bowl safety Derwin James (foot). -- Mike Wells Stat to know: The Bolts are 19-6 (.760) against the AFC South with Philip Rivers at quarterback, and the Colts have lost nine of their past 11 overall with Brissett as their starting quarterback. What to know for fantasy: For his career, T.Y. Hilton averages 1.76 fantasy points per target from Luck. That number dips with Brissett under center, but not as much as you might assume: 1.71 points per target (less than a 3% drop-off). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Indianapolis is 1-10 ATS in Week 1 in the past 11 seasons (2-9 straight up). Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The debuts of Jadeveon Clowney, Ezekiel Ansah and Zac Taylor are the headlines for this one. Seattle will want to ease Clowney (holdout) and Ansah (shoulder) in given that both are coming off extended absences, so don't expect a full workload from either. And Taylor will have his hands full in his debut as Cincinnati's new head coach. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Clowney will have two sacks in his Seattle debut. He probably will be lined up against backup left tackle Andre Smith, the veteran who was signed two days before training camp. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Joe Mixon rushed for 1,168 yards (fourth in the NFL) last season, and he now faces a Seahawks defense that gave up the third-most yards per rush (4.95). What to know for fantasy: In 2018, only Ezekiel Elliott had more runs of 15-plus yards than Mixon (23). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Seattle has won 10 straight home openers and is 7-2 ATS in nine home openers under Pete Carroll. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How much will Ezekiel Elliott play after returning from his holdout and only three practices? In 2017, Elliott returned from a suspension and carried the ball 51 times for 200 yards in the final two games. This time he returns from a holdout with only one padded practice. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Jason Witten will have close to 100 yards receiving and two touchdowns in his first game out of retirement. The Dallas tight end has always feasted against the Giants, which includes four touchdowns in his past five games against them. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: When the Giants have more blockers than defenders in the box, Saquon Barkley takes full advantage. NFL Next Gen Stats has the Giants running back at 6.4 yards per rush last season in that situation, the highest rate of any RB with at least 40 such carries. What to know for fantasy: Barkley scored 49 total fantasy points in his two games against the Cowboys last season and did so in a variety of ways (14 catches in the first game, 109 yards on the ground in the second one). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: New York was 7-1 ATS on the road last season, the best mark in the league. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bucs might have a strong vertical passing attack under Bruce ""No Risk It, No Biscuit"" Arians, but the Niners' pass rush could really do some damage up front against an offensive line that surrendered a whopping 19 sacks in the preseason. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: The 49ers will match their interception total from all of last season by picking off Jameis Winston twice -- but Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans will have a huge game to even things out. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: Niners tight end George Kittle gained 855 of his 1,377 receiving yards last season after the catch, the most by any player since YAC was first tracked in 2006. What to know for fantasy: Only two teams gave up more deep touchdown passes than the 49ers last season, and Winston led the league in air yards per pass attempt. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is 0-7 ATS and straight up in its past seven games where the total was in the 50s. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Cardinals' offense has been a tightly kept secret since coach Kliff Kingsbury was hired in January, leaving plenty of questions about how much Arizona will throw the ball. This will be our first real look. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Arizona QB Kyler Murray ends up with 125 yards passing and 50 yards rushing in the first half, but the Lions' defense stifles him in the second half to force turnovers and give Detroit a come-from-behind win. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Both Murray and Kingsbury are set to make their NFL debuts. According to Elias Sports Bureau research, they would be the third-youngest quarterback-head coach duo to make their NFL debuts in the same game since the merger in 1970 (the Raiders' Steve Beuerlein and Mike Shanahan in 1988, and the Colts' Bert Jones and Howard Schnellenberger in 1973). What to know for fantasy: Kerryon Johnson was RB10 over his final two games of 2018, and he gets a Cardinals defense that allowed the second-most fantasy points to opposing RBs last season. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Quarterbacks making their first career starts are 9-1-1 ATS since 2013 (8-0-1 ATS as the underdog). Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Tom Brady faces the Steelers' pass rush, which tied for an NFL-high 52 sacks last season, with backup center Ted Karras stepping in for David Andrews (IR, blood clots in lungs) and 2018 first-round pick Isaiah Wynn (IR as a rookie/torn Achilles) making his first career start at left tackle. How the Patriots' offensive line protects him might be the difference. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: The Steelers' improved defense will intercept Brady inside Gillette Stadium for the first time ever. Pittsburgh feels it finally has the playmakers in the back seven to match wits with Brady, who has never lost to Pittsburgh at home. -- Jeremy Fowler Stat to know: Brady has a 86.1 Total QBR against the Steelers since the metric was first tracked in 2006, his second-best QBR against a single opponent in that span (91.8 vs. the Bears). What to know for fantasy: In Sony Michel's past four games with at least 15 carries (playoffs included), he ran for seven touchdowns and averaged 22.3 fantasy points per game. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Pittsburgh was 5-0 ATS as an underdog (4-1 outright) last season, including a win vs. New England. But Brady is 7-3-1 ATS against Ben Roethlisberger. Read more.",49.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Saints players and coaches have downplayed the idea of a ""hangover effect"" from the NFC Championship Game, but it sure would help them move on if they could win their first season opener since 2013. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: Drew Brees throws for 400 yards. The Texans' defense lost Tyrann Mathieu, Kareem Jackson and Jadeveon Clowney this offseason, and even with some new additions, Brees and Michael Thomas could take advantage of the Texans' secondary. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: Brees becomes the sixth different quarterback to start a season opener at age 40 or older since 1950, joining Tom Brady, Brett Favre, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Johnny Unitas. And the Saints are 20-6 at home in prime time under Brees (2-0 last season). What to know for fantasy: Keke Coutee is unlikely to play, and Will Fuller went over 100 receiving yards with a touchdown in all three games he played with Coutee inactive in 2018. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Houston QB Deshaun Watson is 7-2 ATS as an underdog in his career (4-5 straight up). Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How emotionally drained will the Raiders be from the Antonio Brown on-again, off-again saga? The adrenaline rush from a season opener will carry the Raiders early, and an improved defense should hold the Broncos at bay. But with Brown officially released, Oakland will now move on without him. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: The Broncos sacked Derek Carr at least three times in three of their first four meetings but haven't sacked him more than twice in a game in any of the past five meetings. Denver will need to sack him at least four times Monday night to get a road win. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: The Broncos have won seven consecutive season openers, the longest active streak in the NFL and the longest streak in franchise history. But they've also lost three straight at the Raiders and three straight games on Monday Night Football -- all to AFC West opponents. What to know for fantasy: Denver allowed the fifth-most deep touchdown passes last season, and Tyrell Williams, likely stepping into a more prominent role than ever before, ranks fourth in yards per catch during his career (minimum 150 catches). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Denver is 5-13 ATS in its past 18 road games and 2-8 ATS in its past 10 divisional games. Read more.",38.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Packers want to run the ball more like the Vikings did last week and improve on the 2.1 yards per carry that Green Bay averaged against the Bears in Week 1. OK, maybe the Packers won't be looking to run 38 times with only 10 passes like Minnesota did Sunday against the Falcons, but coach Matt LaFleur has put an emphasis on the run game this week. But it won't be easy executing against another potential top-10 defense. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Both quarterbacks will be sacked a minimum of four times. Minnesota has sacked Aaron Rodgers an average of four times per game since 2015. The improvements the Packers have made to their defensive front forced Mitchell Trubisky down five times last week, so Kirk Cousins could be under duress quite a bit at Lambeau Field, too. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Packers receiver Davante Adams will likely receive coverage from Minnesota cornerback Xavier Rhodes this week. According to NFL Next Gen Stats, Rhodes was the closest defender to Adams on 16 targets last season, which Adams turned into 12 receptions, 124 yards and two touchdowns. What to know for fantasy: Vikings receiver Stefon Diggs has scored in each of his past five meetings with the Packers, averaging 24.4 points per game in the process. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Teams that start 1-0 are 5-18 against the spread (ATS) when they go on the road in Week 2 -- as the 1-0 Vikings do this Sunday -- since the start of 2016. Read more.",41.0,LOW
" What to watch for: How will the Titans' wide receivers match up against those Colts cornerbacks? Rookies A.J. Brown and Rock Ya-Sin are two physical players, setting up for a fun battle, while Adam Humphries versus Kenny Moore II is a duel of cat-quick players. Perhaps the best one-on-one for Tennessee will be Corey Davis against Pierre Desir. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: The Titans will not have more than two sacks. Tennessee sacked Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield five times (and intercepted him three times) in Week 1. But the Colts have a better offensive line, as they limited Joey Bosa, Melvin Ingram and the rest of the Chargers' defense to just two sacks in Week 1. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: The Colts have won eight of their past 10 road games against the Titans dating back to 2009, averaging 27.1 points per game in those contests. What to know for fantasy: Derrick Henry is one of only two running backs (Christian McCaffrey) to have scored at least 27 points on three different occasions since Week 14 of last season. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Indianapolis is 13-2 straight up and 11-4 ATS in its past 15 games against Tennessee. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: After 154 all-purpose yards in Week 1, Chargers running back Austin Ekeler will face a good defensive front in Detroit. If Ekeler can shake loose against the Lions, it could be a long day for Detroit because it would open up even more passing lanes for Philip Rivers. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Joey Bosa records three sacks. The Chargers should heat up the pass rush against a Lions offensive line that allowed three Matthew Stafford sacks in the team's season opener against the Cardinals. -- Eric D. Williams Stat to know: Rivers posted a Total QBR of 80 on the road last season, the second-best number in the NFL. And the Lions lost four of their final five home games last season and scored 16 points or fewer in each of the four losses. What to know for fantasy: Ekeler racked up 39.4 fantasy points last weekend, a total that is 3.3 points higher than Melvin Gordon's career high. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Los Angeles is 16-8-2 ATS in its past 26 regular-season games that start at 1 p.m. ET. Read more.",52.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: In the 30-point loss to the Patriots, Pittsburgh was successful on 25% of its third downs and picked up one of three fourth downs. And the Steelers failed to convert on three third-and-1 situations. They will be trying to remedy their previous shortcomings against a tough Seattle front that now includes Jadeveon Clowney. -- Jeremy Fowler Bold prediction: The Seahawks' secondary will have a new look and much better results compared to the opener, when Seattle allowed Andy Dalton to throw for a career-high 418 yards. Free safety Tedric Thompson, who misplayed a ball that resulted in a 55-yard touchdown, may be out of the starting lineup due to that mistake and/or a leg injury that kept him from practicing Wednesday. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was 6-for-8 for 75 yards and a 95 QBR when targeting JuJu Smith-Schuster on Sunday. But when he looked elsewhere, he completed just 54% of his passes and his QBR fell to 12. What to know for fantasy: Each of Roethlisberger's top eight career fantasy performances has come at home. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The over is 11-2 in Pittsburgh's past 13 games as a home favorite. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Can Laremy Tunsil and the Texans' offensive line protect Deshaun Watson? In Week 1, the Jaguars did not sack Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, but Watson was sacked an NFL-high six times in the Texans' season opener. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: The Jaguars will give running back Leonard Fournette 30 touches (or close to it) in Gardner Minshew's first start at quarterback. The Texans' pass-rushers should be pretty eager to get after the rookie, especially J.J. Watt, who did not record a sack, QB hit or tackle against the Saints for the first time in a game in his career. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Minshew posted the highest completion percentage (88%, min. 15 attempts) in an NFL debut in league history, and his 13 consecutive completions to begin his career was the longest streak by a player who debuted over the past 40 years. Per Elias Sports Bureau research, Minshew will be the first rookie QB drafted in the sixth round or later to start a game this early in the season since Don Majkowski did so for the Packers in 1987. What to know for fantasy: Jags receiver Dede Westbrook is averaging 7.6 targets per game over his past five contests. That's more than Brandin Cooks averaged in 2018. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The past 24 quarterbacks to make their first career start as an underdog of at least seven points are 16-8 ATS. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: How will the Ravens defend the Air Raid offense with their banged-up secondary? Cornerback Jimmy Smith (ankle) and nickelback Tavon Young (neck) are out Sunday, and top corner Marlon Humphrey (back) is not at full strength. The Cardinals will test the depth of the Baltimore secondary, as they used at least four wide receivers on 58 plays in Week 1. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Arizona QB Kyler Murray will throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns. Murray showed just what he's capable of during the fourth quarter in Week 1. It's safe to say that coach Kliff Kingsbury learned his lesson and won't be as creative early on in Baltimore. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: Lamar Jackson enters the matchup at 7-1 as a starting quarterback. Only 12 QBs in the Super Bowl era have started their careers at 8-1 or better through nine starts. What to know for fantasy: In Week 1, Jackson had more touchdown passes (five) than rush attempts (three). In his rookie season, Jackson had six touchdown passes and 147 rushing attempts. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Baltimore is 31-0 all-time straight up as a double-digit favorite, the only active franchise to never lose such a game. However, it is 3-10 ATS in the past 13 such games. Read more.",56.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Redskins' passing game -- with tight end Jordan Reed working the inside and rookie receiver Terry McLaurin (125 yards last week) on the outside -- will be something to watch in this NFC East matchup. But Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott is 5-1 versus Washington, with six touchdowns and no interceptions. And he connected eight times with Amari Cooper for 180 yards in a win over Washington last season. -- John Keim Bold prediction: The Redskins' Adrian Peterson will rush for more than 100 yards and score to break a tie with Hall of Famer Jim Brown for the fifth-most touchdowns in league history with 106. The Cowboys allowed only three 100-yard rushers last season, but Peterson came close with 24 carries for 99 yards at FedEx Field. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: Prescott set career highs on play-action last week, going 14-of-15 for 207 yards and three touchdowns. He was also 9-for-11 on throws 10-plus yards downfield. What to know for fantasy: Dallas receiver Michael Gallup had seven catches for 109 yards through six weeks last season. On Sunday against the Giants, he caught all seven of his targets for 158 yards. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Regarding Washington, 0-1 teams that are home underdogs in their second game of the season are 25-8 ATS and 19-15 straight up since 2010. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: You could see potential career days for Sony Michel, James White and the Patriots' running game. The Dolphins loaded the box to stop the Ravens' run game last week, and as a result, they were torched by Lamar Jackson's arm. But even then, they still gave up 265 rushing yards to Mark Ingram II and the rest of the Ravens' backfield. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: Assuming the NFL doesn't step in and place him on the commissioner's exempt list, Pats receiver Antonio Brown will play and score at least one touchdown. Tom Brady will want to get Brown involved early in his New England debut. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: The Dolphins sustained blocks through 2.5 seconds just 35% of the time in Week 1, the second-worst rate in the NFL according to ESPN's pass block win rate using NFL Next Gen Stats. Meanwhile, Michael Bennett had a pass rush win rate of 39% in Week 1, third-best among individual pass-rushers. What to know for fantasy: The Patriots have struggled in Miami recently, but Brady has been a top-three fantasy quarterback in two of his past three trips to South Beach. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: No team in the Super Bowl era has ever been more than an 18-point favorite on the road before the end of September. The largest home underdog in that span was 18 points, done twice (1969 and 1970). Both of those underdogs were shut out and did not cover. Read more.",58.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: San Francisco created four turnovers in the win over Tampa Bay, including two interceptions returned for touchdowns. The 49ers will be a good test for a revamped Bengals offense under rookie coach Zac Taylor. In last week's loss to the Seahawks, the Bengals racked up 418 passing yards. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: The 49ers will get five sacks. San Francisco sacked Jameis Winston three times in Week 1, but it could have been more had Winston not been so adept at evading the rush. Andy Dalton isn't as slippery, and the Bengals yielded five sacks to Seattle in their first game. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: San Francisco only made two interceptions last season, the fewest by any team since 1940. But then it picked off three passes in a Week 1 win to start 2019. The Niners have not had multiple interceptions in each of their first two games of a season since 1974. What to know for fantasy: Bengals receiver John Ross III has caught seven touchdown passes in his past eight games played without A.J. Green. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is 5-12 ATS in 1:00 p.m. ET games since 2015. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Saquon Barkley ran for 120 yards on just 11 carries in Week 1, the second-fewest carries in his career. That's not likely to happen again, especially against a Bills defense that has been so good against the pass since the start of last season. ""We all know that Saquon is a focus of our offense. ... Yeah, we want him to get the football,"" coach Pat Shurmur said. It's not hard to see where this one is headed, for good reason. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Bills quarterback Josh Allen set a career high in Week 1 with 254 passing yards -- he'll set another career high in Week 2 with his first 300-yard game through the air against a Giants secondary that just surrendered 405 passing yards to Dak Prescott. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: The Giants are 4-12 at home over the past two seasons, the worst home win percentage (.250) in the NFL during that span. But they need a win to avoid a sixth 0-2 start in their past seven seasons. What to know for fantasy: Eli Manning has thrown for 300 yards in three consecutive games, matching the longest streak of his career. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: New York is 6-15-1 ATS in its past 22 September games since 2013, and it has failed to cover its past seven Week 2 games. Read more.",38.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Raiders would like nothing more than to duplicate their 13-play, 95-yard drive in 8:35 on Monday night against the Broncos to keep Kansas City's offense off the field. They have beaten the Chiefs only twice in their past 12 meetings, but both of those games were in Oakland. As Kansas City coach Andy Reid said, ""There's just something about that place that's crazy."" -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: The Chiefs will score at least 35 points against the Raiders for the third consecutive game despite losing wide receiver Tyreek Hill. The Chiefs topped 35 points early in the fourth quarter last week against Jacksonville and still have plenty of weapons, including rookie receiver Mecole Hardman and veteran running back LeSean McCoy. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Oakland running back Josh Jacobs tallied 113 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns in his NFL debut. Only two players since 1970 have gained 100 scrimmage yards and scored twice in each of their first two games: Kareem Hunt in 2017 and Billy Sims in 1980. What to know for fantasy: Since the beginning of last season, only Sammy Watkins, Zach Ertz and Amari Cooper have multiple games with at least eight catches, 100 receiving yards and multiple receiving scores. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Regarding Kansas City, 1-0 teams that are road favorites in Week 2 are 0-9 ATS since 2016 and 6-24 ATS since 2010. Read more.",68.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Watch for the Rams to weather an early storm led by Saints quarterback Drew Brees and running back Alvin Kamara, who gained 169 all-purpose yards last week. But how much the Rams will deploy running back Todd Gurley II remains a mystery. If he is let loose, he could have himself a day against a Saints run defense that struggled mightily last week and allowed 180 rushing yards to the Texans. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Greg Zuerlein strikes again with a game-winning field goal in the final minute after his 48-yarder forced overtime in the NFC Championship Game and his 57-yarder sent the Rams to the Super Bowl. This is the toughest game on the Saints' 2019 schedule and it should come down to the wire. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: In Week 1, the Saints pressured Deshaun Watson on 44.7% of his dropbacks, New Orleans' third-highest rate in a game over the last three seasons. And in their lone win against the Rams over that time (including the playoffs), the Saints pressured Jared Goff on 33% of his dropbacks. Goff was pressured on only 26% of his dropbacks in the Saints' losses to Los Angeles. What to know for fantasy: Gurley's streak of 33 straight games with a red zone carry was snapped last week. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Since 2014, New Orleans is 21-8 ATS as an underdog. Only New England has a better cover percentage in that span (7-1). Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: It will be the tale of two pass rushes. The Bears sacked Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers five times in the opener. Meanwhile, the Broncos didn't sack Raiders quarterback Derek Carr at all and didn't even register a single hit on him. It was the first time in more than four seasons the Broncos had not registered a quarterback hit in a game. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Bears rookie running back David Montgomery will touch the ball 15-plus times. Chicago coach Matt Nagy took tons of grief for not using Montgomery (seven touches) more in Week 1, but the Bears will not repeat that mistake. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Denver is 5-1 when Phillip Lindsay has 100-plus scrimmage yards since the running back debuted last season. But it is 1-9 when he does not reach that threshold over that span. What to know for fantasy: Bears receiver Allen Robinson has three straight games, including the playoffs, with at least six catches and 85 receiving yards. The only receivers who have had a longer such streak since the beginning of last season are Adam Thielen, Julio Jones and DeAndre Hopkins. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Denver has won 13 straight September home games (8-3-2 ATS). Read more.",26.5,LOW
" What to watch for: What adjustments will the Falcons make in their red zone offense? The Falcons are 2-of-9 in the red zone in their past three games against the Eagles, all losses. Matt Ryan went 4-of-17 for 19 yards with one touchdown and one interception in the red zone during those games and was sacked twice. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Tight end Zach Ertz will score two touchdowns. Week 1 was all about the long ball to DeSean Jackson, but Carson Wentz will have to play a more methodical brand of offense against Atlanta's Cover 3 defense, which will give up passes underneath to avoid the big play. That should lead to a good day for Ertz. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Against the Eagles since 2016 (including the playoffs), Ryan has posted a Total QBR of 30, averaged 243 passing yards and completed just 55% of his passes. Those numbers are significantly below what they are against all other opponents: Total QBR of 74, 294 passing yards per game and a 69% completion percentage. What to know for fantasy: The Falcons' Calvin Ridley has caught a touchdown pass in three straight games after catching a total of two touchdown passes in his previous 10 contests. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Since drafting Ryan in 2008, Atlanta is 10-1 straight up and 10-1 ATS in home openers. Ryan is also 11-4 ATS as a home underdog. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Without quarterback Sam Darnold (mononucleosis), the Jets will turn to Trevor Siemian to save them from an 0-2 start. The Gregg Williams-coached defense will have to play out of its mind to beat Baker Mayfield and Odell Beckham Jr., who accused Williams of teaching his players how to execute dirty hits. Williams, fired by the Browns after last season, will ""have a chip on his shoulder,"" as New York safety Jamal Adams said. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: Much like in last year's Bud Light Fridge Game against the Jets, Mayfield dazzles under the lights with three prime-time touchdown passes, placing Cleveland's hype train back on its track after that disastrous Week 1 performance. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: In their Week 1 loss to the Titans, the Browns had at least three wide receivers on the field for 60 of their 63 snaps (95%). That was the team's second-most such snaps in a game over the last 10 seasons (61 snaps versus the Chargers last season). But Mayfield did not throw a touchdown and tossed three interceptions -- all in the fourth quarter -- while targeting Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry. What to know for fantasy: In Week 1, the Jets were the second-worst team in preventing yards before first contact. Why does that matter? Since the beginning of last season, Browns running back Nick Chubb ranks as the fifth-best back after first contact. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Cleveland has not been a road favorite of at least five points since 1995, when Bill Belichick was still its head coach. Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Ravens defended Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs about as well as any opponent did last season. Can Baltimore give Mahomes fits again? The Chiefs, who didn't score in the second half of their Week 2 game against the Raiders, are depleted, facing the Ravens without wide receiver Tyreek Hill, left tackle Eric Fisher and potentially running back Damien Williams. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Mahomes throws for five touchdowns. Baltimore was able to contain Mahomes last season because of its pass rush, but the Ravens won't be able to get consistent pressure on Mahomes, who will make Baltimore pay this time. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: Ravens QB Lamar Jackson has completed 57% of his passes thrown 15-plus yards downfield, up from 39% last season. What to know for fantasy: Since 2014, Mahomes (2018) and Jackson (2019) are responsible for two of the four best QB performances through their teams' first two games. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Kansas City has covered nine consecutive September games. Read more.",73.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: All eyes will be on Adam Vinatieri to see if the Colts' veteran kicker has figured out the ""demons"" in his head. The NFL's all-time leading scorer, he has missed seven kicks in the past three games (including a playoff loss to Kansas City last season). He said there's no added pressure on him Sunday, but the Colts might view that differently, considering they worked out six kickers on Tuesday. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Falcons QB Matt Ryan will throw four touchdown passes without an interception -- including two to Calvin Ridley -- as he silences the talk about him throwing five interceptions over the first two games. -- Vaughn McClure Stat to know: The Colts are 14-2 all time against the Falcons, the best record by one team versus a single opponent in the Super Bowl era (minimum 15 meetings). But the Colts have also lost five consecutive home openers. What to know for fantasy: Indianapolis running back Marlon Mack has at least 20 carries in three straight games, but he has just 11 receiving yards in those games. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta is 0-11 against the spread (ATS) in its past 11 games against AFC opponents, including Super Bowl LI. And since 2013, Atlanta is 5-20 ATS against AFC teams. Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Eagles are likely to be without top receivers DeSean Jackson (abdominal strain) and Alshon Jeffery (calf), meaning Nelson Agholor steps into the role of lead receiver. Expect the Eagles to lean on Jordan Howard, Miles Sanders and the ground attack more than usual. And look for Detroit's receivers to have big days against a secondary that has yielded six touchdown passes through two games. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Despite that depleted receiving corps, Carson Wentz throws two touchdown passes, including the winner with under five minutes remaining. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: The Eagles have allowed 680 yards passing through two games, second most in the NFL. And Matthew Stafford's 630 passing yards is the league's fifth most. His 8.40 yards per pass attempt would be highest in his career. What to know for fantasy: After going scoreless in his final five games of 2018, Kenny Golladay has scored in both games this season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Since the start of last season, Philadelphia is 3-10 ATS with Wentz as its starter, including 1-6 ATS at home. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" What to watch for: It's Vic Fangio versus Aaron Rodgers. Fangio is a first-year head coach, but he beat Rodgers all four times he faced him as the 49ers' defensive coordinator (including two playoff games). However, Rodgers did get the better of him over the past four years that Fangio ran the Bears' D. While Rodgers is still figuring out new coach Matt LaFleur's offense, he should have a good idea of what Fangio's defense will try to do against him. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Despite having zero sacks or forced turnovers in their first two games -- the first time that's happened since 2007 -- the Broncos drop Rodgers at least four times and force two turnovers. The Bears got Rodgers five times in Week 1, and if Denver does that, it'll have a chance for its first victory of the season. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Rodgers has a 36.1 Total QBR so far this season (24th in the NFL), but he did post 408 passing yards and four touchdowns through the air in his only career home game against Denver (Week 4, 2011). What to know for fantasy: Packers running back Aaron Jones is coming off of his first career 20-plus-carry game and his second game with 30 receiving yards. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Each of the past 10 Denver games has gone under the total. Read more.",38.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How do the Patriots configure their offensive line without starting left tackle Isaiah Wynn and starting center David Andrews? One possibility is moving left guard Joe Thuney to left tackle, but that could weaken the line in two spots. This is the Jets' best chance to make it a game, with their strong defensive line winning the matchup up front. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: The Jets, with third-string quarterback Luke Falk making his first NFL start, will fail to score a touchdown for the second consecutive game. Truth be told, the offense wasn't functioning well with Sam Darnold and Trevor Siemian, so it's unreasonable to expect a former practice-squad QB to provide the spark. Le'Veon Bell will get 30 touches, but coach Bill Belichick won't let the run game beat him. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: Bell has just one touchdown in four career games against the Patriots, including the playoffs. Considering New York's QB situation, the Patriots could become the first team since the 1937 Bears to allow zero touchdowns in each of the first three games of the season, per Elias Sports Bureau research. What to know for fantasy: Patriots RB Sony Michel has scored in each of his past five games in which he got at least 15 carries (playoffs included). See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: New England is 0-4 ATS in the Belichick era as a favorite of at least 20 points. The most recent such game happened in 2011. Read more.",40.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Quarterback Kirk Cousins said his future with the Vikings is on the line after one of the worst performances of his career in Green Bay. Meanwhile, the Raiders' pass defense gave up 249 yards and a touchdown to Denver in Week 1, and 443 yards and four passing touchdowns to Patrick Mahomes in Week 2. So if there's a time for Cousins to earn a bounce-back victory, Week 3 presents the best chance. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Kicker Daniel Carlson, a former Vikings fifth-round draft pick who was cut in 2018, will drill a game winner for the Raiders. Carlson is 19-of-20 on field goal attempts since signing with Oakland last Oct. 23. ""That was some tough times, obviously, getting cut early on in my NFL career, but it's been fun just seeing how it's all worked out,"" Carlson said this week. ""I think I'm in a great spot here in Oakland ... it's not some personal vendetta for me."" -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Derek Carr has thrown multiple touchdown passes in just one of his past 15 road games (14 TDs, 15 interceptions in those games). And the Raiders have lost 10 of their past 11 road games. What to know for fantasy: There were 234 instances in which a quarterback completed at least 23 passes in a game last season. Cousins has completed just 22 combined through two weeks. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Mike Zimmer is 30-12-1 ATS at home as Minnesota's head coach. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Cowboys will look to continue their fast start offensively, even without their leading receiver, Michael Gallup. The Dolphins' defense has allowed 12 touchdowns in two games, while the Cowboys have scored touchdowns on nine of 19 possessions in two games. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: After scoring just one touchdown through the first two weeks, the Dolphins double up, scoring two to slightly cover the 21.5-point spread. Miami's offense has been abysmal, but we are getting bold. Even so, Dallas still wins easily. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott is 22-of-24 for 318 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions on play-action passes this season. What to know for fantasy: With Gallup out, it's worth noting that since 2017, Amari Cooper is averaging 22.3 points per game when seeing at least eight targets. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Teams that are underdogs by at least 20 points have covered all five games in the past 15 seasons. Read more.",50.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Bengals average the second-most passing yards per game in the NFL this season but are dead last in rushing yards. Meanwhile, the Bills' defense ranks in the top 10 against both the pass and the run. If Cincy can't get its run game going, it could be a long Sunday in Buffalo's home opener. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Joe Mixon will get 75 yards from scrimmage. This doesn't seem like a bold prediction, but as Marcel pointed out, the Bengals do have the worst ground attack in the NFL, and Mixon has been stifled through two games. Look for the running back to get the ball in various ways against the Bills. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen has at least one passing touchdown and one rushing touchdown in three consecutive games dating back to last season. The only player since the 1970 merger to both rush and pass for a score in four consecutive games was Michael Vick with the Eagles in 2010. What to know for fantasy: Cincinnati's John Ross is the only player in football with a 50-plus-yard reception in both weeks this season, but opponents have completed just one deep pass (15-plus air yards) against Buffalo this season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Since 2017, 0-2 teams are 12-4 ATS and 11-2 as underdogs. Read more.",41.0,LOW
" What to watch for: In Week 2, the Bucs held Christian McCaffrey to a career-low 2.9 yards per touch and no touchdowns. But they believe the Giants' Saquon Barkley is an even bigger test. ""They're on different planets,"" Tampa Bay coach Bruce Arians said of McCaffrey versus Barkley. ""Saquon's bigger, stronger, faster. He's got more 50-yard runs than anybody I've seen in a long time."" -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: New Giants starting quarterback Daniel Jones throws for 300-plus yards in his NFL debut. The first-rounder will show that the preseason was not a fluke and that the future isn't so bleak for the Giants, experiencing more success against the Bucs than most anticipate. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: Jones was 7-of-8 with two passing touchdowns on throws 15-plus yards downfield and outside the numbers in the preseason. What to know for fantasy: Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans has only 14.9 points this season. He finished 2018 as WR9, and he had a two-game stretch in Weeks 9-10 when he scored just 10.7 points. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: New York is 7-2 ATS in road games under Pat Shurmur, including 7-0 ATS in games against teams other than Dallas. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: How the Cardinals perform in the red zone will determine whether they win this game. Quarterback Kyler Murray will continue to pile up yards between the 20s, but this weekend might be different. Coach Kliff Kingsbury has shown he can adapt as a playcaller, and Week 3 will be another chance for him to adjust to the NFL. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Undrafted second-year quarterback Kyle Allen will be more productive than former Texas A&M teammate Murray. He'll throw for more than 250 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions to run his record as an NFL starter to 2-0. -- David Newton Stat to know: The Cardinals have run the fifth-most plays on offense (136) through two games. They average 23.4 seconds per play, the second-fastest time of possession per play behind ... the Panthers (23.1 seconds). What to know for fantasy: Arizona receiver Larry Fitzgerald is the only player with 10 targets and 100 receiving yards in each of the first two weeks this season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Carolina is 2-8 ATS in its past 10 games (1-9 outright). Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: This game features two of the best receivers in the game in Houston's DeAndre Hopkins and Los Angeles' Keenan Allen. Hopkins and Allen are second and third in the NFL in receptions (224 and 215, respectively) since the start of the 2017 season. Hopkins' fellow Clemson product Mike Williams is averaging an impressive 22.4 yards per reception through two games. -- Eric D. Williams Bold prediction: Deshaun Watson is sacked more than four times. The Chargers have only two sacks through two games, tied for 28th this season. But even though the Houston offensive line played better in Week 2, Watson will still continue to get hit. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: Watson is throwing 20.3% of his passes into tight windows, the third-highest rate in the NFL, both according to NFL Next Gen Stats research. And among wide receivers targeted 15-plus times, Hopkins is facing press coverage 35.4% of the time this season (fifth in NFL) to average just 5.2 yards of cushion (seventh least), per NFL Next Gen Stats data. What to know for fantasy: Austin Ekeler and Le'Veon Bell are the only two players with 50 rushing yards and six receptions in both weeks this season. In 2018, Christian McCaffrey, Ezekiel Elliott (twice) and Todd Gurley were the only backs to have consecutive such games. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Watson is 8-2 ATS in his career as an underdog, including 7-1 ATS as a road underdog. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Teddy Bridgewater will be trying to keep the Saints' playoff hopes on track while Drew Brees recovers from thumb surgery expected to sideline him more than a month. Bridgewater's first start of the season comes against a Seahawks defense expected to have defensive end Ezekiel Ansah making his Seattle debut opposite Jadeveon Clowney. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: The Saints will run for 120-plus yards against Seattle's fourth-ranked run defense. Coach Sean Payton will get creative with his use of Bridgewater and Taysom Hill in Brees' absence. But he'll also lean heavily on one of the most loaded offensive lines in football. Payton was hard on his line after the Week 2 loss in L.A., chastising it for getting ""whupped"" up front by the Rams. He'll demand it leads the charge this time around. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: According to ESPN pressure metrics using NFL Next Gen Stats data, the Seahawks' offensive line has a pass block win rate of 33% this season, the second worst in the NFL. Russell Wilson has been sacked eight times already, tied for third most. What to know for fantasy: Chris Carson outcarried Rashaad Penny 15-6 in Week 1 and ran for a touchdown. But in Week 2, Carson's edge fell to 15-10, and Penny ran for the score. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Bridgewater is 12-2 ATS in his career as an underdog. Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: How will Mason Rudolph perform replacing an injured Ben Roethlisberger as the Steelers' starting quarterback? And will the 49ers find a capable fill-in for stalwart left tackle Joe Staley? Stepping in for Roethlisberger or Staley is no easy task, and the team that does a better job coming up with solutions likely will be the one to come away with the victory. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: James Washington will score two touchdowns. The wide receiver was one of Rudolph's favorite targets in college, and he'll be a solid safety blanket for Rudolph's first NFL start. Washington hasn't been very involved in the Steelers' offense and has only one NFL touchdown, but everything changes with Rudolph as QB1. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: Matt Breida has averaged 5.4 yards per rush since start of 2018, the most among running backs, and he has nine rushes reaching 15-plus mph this season -- third in the NFL -- per NFL Next Gen Stats data. What to know for fantasy: Thirty-two of Washington's 39 collegiate touchdown receptions came from Rudolph. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is 1-12-1 ATS in its past 14 games as a favorite (5-9 outright), including 0-4 ATS last season (1-3 outright). It is also 0-11-1 ATS in its past 12 games as a home favorite. Read more.",41.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Can Cleveland's beleaguered offensive line protect Baker Mayfield facing off against Aaron Donald and a ferocious Rams front? Only two other quarterbacks have held the ball longer on average through two weeks than Mayfield, according to NFL Next Gen Stats research. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: Donald sacks Mayfield at least twice. The two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year has zero sacks through two weeks. That spells trouble for Mayfield behind a Browns offensive line that has been less than stellar. The Rams' pass rush has been solid from the edges, but on Sunday, it will be Donald who dominates. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Over the first two games, the Rams have scored just 19 of their 57 points in the first half after ranking second in the league last season with an average of 17.4 points per first half. What to know for fantasy: Mayfield has failed to throw for multiple scores in each of his first two games this season, but he has never had three consecutive such games. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Los Angeles has covered six of its past seven games, with the only exception being Super Bowl LIII, and the Rams have covered all five games as a favorite in that span. Read more.",50.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: It's a matchup between a struggling quarterback (Mitchell Trubisky) and a struggling defense (Washington ranks 30th in yards per game allowed and has just two sacks in 72 pass attempts). The Redskins' offense will want to get the ball down the middle of the field to receiver Terry McLaurin, but that could be tough against this Chicago defense. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Bears rookie David Montgomery rushes for more than 150 yards. Chicago coach Matt Nagy is expected to ride the hot hand Monday night, and that probably won't be Trubisky. The Bears believe Montgomery only scratched the surface with his performance last weekend in Denver (18 carries, 62 yards and a touchdown). -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: McLaurin had at least 60 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in each of his first two career games. He is the first player to accomplish that feat since Calvin Johnson in 2007, and if McLaurin posts those numbers Monday night, he would be the second player since the 1970 merger to do so in each of his first three career games (Louis Lipps in 1984). What to know for fantasy: Montgomery had just 18 rushing yards in his NFL debut, but in Week 2, he had 18 carries. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Since 2015, Washington is 0-6 outright and ATS in Monday Night Football games. Read more.",24.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Patrick Mahomes hasn't played in a dome as a pro, and playing indoors at Ford Field should make Kansas City's offense somehow more dangerous. If Lions cornerbacks Darius Slay and Rashaan Melvin are not at full strength, Mahomes and the Chiefs could be extra special on Sunday. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Travis Kelce will catch a couple of touchdown passes. Kelce has only one this season, and Detroit has done a nice job of defending tight ends, giving up only seven completions. But the Lions have also given up 93 yards on those passes, and they haven't faced a tight end with Kelce's ability. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: According to ESPN's coverage analysis using NFL Next Gen Stats research, Mahomes is averaging 12.5 yards per attempt with six passing touchdowns when facing zone coverage this season, both of which are the best in the NFL. But the Lions have used man coverage on 68% of their snaps this season, the third most of any team this season. What to know for fantasy: Mahomes had the greatest fantasy season ever by a quarterback last season. But if he scores 28.5 points Sunday, he will actually be ahead of where he was through four games in 2018. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Matthew Stafford is 9-16 against the spread (ATS) in his career as a home underdog. Read more.",61.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Josh Allen has yet to turn in four quarters of mistake-free football this season, but he'll need to against the Patriots. A large part of his game is his ability to improvise. Whether he'll be able to make smart improvisational decisions against an opportunistic New England defense will determine how successful the Bills' offense will be Sunday. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Sony Michel will lead the way on offense for New England, as the Patriots' running game will find its groove after three outings in which the attack has trended more toward the pass. Michel, who has totaled only 108 rushing yards over three games, will top the 100-yard mark in a close contest that will be decided in the fourth quarter. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: New England has won 17 consecutive games against first- or second-year starting quarterbacks. And the Patriots' man defense could spell trouble for Allen. According to ESPN coverage metrics powered by NFL Next Gen Stats data, the Patriots use man coverage at the second-highest rate in the league (68%), and Allen averages just 6.6 yards per attempt versus man, compared with 8.0 yards per attempt versus zone. What to know for fantasy: Tom Brady has failed to score more than 15.6 fantasy points in each of his past four games against the Bills. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Last season, New England was 1-5 outright as a single-digit road favorite, including 0-3 outright when favored by 6-9 points on the road. Read more.",35.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How the Falcons' receivers perform against the Tennessee secondary will be key. If Jacksonville's Gardner Minshew was able to connect downfield on the Titans, surely Matt Ryan can do the same. Keep an eye on Calvin Ridley, who vowed not to let a hip injury hold him back. He had only one target last weekend, and offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter wants to get him more involved. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Outside linebacker Harold Landry will have two sacks. He has been relatively quiet, having posted only one sack through three games, but he'll get home against the Falcons with Ryan waiting for the deep routes to develop with his receivers. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: Julio Jones has a receiving touchdown in seven consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NFL. A.J. Green (nine in 2012), Antonio Brown (eight in 2018) and Wes Welker (eight in 2012 and '13) are the only players with eight-game streaks over the past 10 seasons. What to know for fantasy: Since Week 13 of last season, Derrick Henry has run for 11 touchdowns. No other player has more than seven. And over that stretch, only Christian McCaffrey has more fantasy points among running backs. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta has failed to cover in 12 consecutive games against AFC opponents, including the Week 3 loss against Indianapolis. The Falcons are 5-21 ATS in their past 26 games against AFC opponents, including 4-14 ATS under Dan Quinn. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Ravens' offensive line could have problems against the Browns' pass rush, which is the best Baltimore has played this season ""by a long way,"" according to coach John Harbaugh. Lamar Jackson is averaging 99 yards rushing per game in his five regular-season starts at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium, but how will the pass rush affect that part of his game? -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Two of Baker Mayfield's former Oklahoma teammates, Marquise Brown and Mark Andrews, score touchdowns as Jackson prevails in a shootout of former Heisman Trophy-winning QBs. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: The Ravens have blitzed on 47% of opposing QB dropbacks this season, the highest mark in the NFL. And they boast the NFL's fourth-best pass rush win rate, beating blocks within 2.5 seconds 58% of the time, per NFL Next Gen Stats research. What to know for fantasy: Nick Chubb has the chance to join Todd Gurley as the only players since 2009 to have at least 17 carries and three receptions in each of their teams' first four games of a season (Gurley did it in 2018). See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Last season, Baltimore failed to cover in all five divisional games in which it was the favorite, including both tries against Cleveland. Read more.",56.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Texans haven't allowed a player to rush for more than 100 yards since Week 17 of the 2017 season, the third-longest active streak in the NFL, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. Can Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey, who has more than 100 rushing yards in two of three games this season, break that streak? -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: Carolina quarterback Kyle Allen will follow his four-touchdown pass performance against Arizona with three against Houston, which has given up only five touchdown passes in three games. He'll also top 250 yards passing against a defense that is stingy against the run. -- David Newton Stat to know: The Panthers' defense is using zone coverage on 72% of its snaps in 2019, the second-highest rate in the NFL. And the unit is giving up a league-low 4.6 yards per play this season in that coverage, per ESPN's coverage metrics powered by NFL Next Gen Stats data. What to know for fantasy: Allen has made two starts in his NFL career, resulting in seven total touchdowns and a pair of top-7 fantasy finishes at the position. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Allen seeks to be the second quarterback in the Super Bowl era to begin his career 3-0 despite being an underdog in each game. Patrick Mahomes is the other. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Colts had eight sacks in their first two games of the season, but as pass-rusher Justin Houston noted, Atlanta's Matt Ryan did a good job of getting a rid of the ball quickly to cause the Colts to go sackless in Week 3. Don't be surprised if Derek Carr and the Raiders try to do the same thing Sunday. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: The Raiders will ride rookie running back Josh Jacobs, whose touches have fallen from 24 to 12 to 10 in three games, to establish the run game early and set up the play-action passing game. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Carr quietly has the third-highest completion percentage (73.5%) in the NFL this season, but he is also averaging just 7.1 yards per attempt (20th in NFL) and 6.4 air yards per attempt (31st). What to know for fantasy: Oakland's Darren Waller ranks second in the NFL, across all positions, with 26 catches this season, and he is facing a Colts team that has given up more tight-end receptions than any other team since the beginning of last season (121).

He is 4-1 both straight up and against the spread as a favorite in his career. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Keenan Allen probably will rack up huge receiving yards in this one. He had 183 yards and two touchdowns on 13 catches last weekend against the Texans, and now he has to be licking his chops facing the Dolphins' banged-up secondary. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Allen eclipse 200 yards. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: Chargers running back Austin Ekeler goes for more than 100 rushing yards for the first time as a pro. The Dolphins are giving up a league-worst 208 rushing yards per game. Melvin Gordon's holdout is over, but Sunday's game will be Ekeler's opportunity to put up big numbers against a lackluster Miami run defense. -- Eric D. Williams Stat to know: The Dolphins are trying to avoid becoming the third team to lose four consecutive games by 25-plus points in same season. It hasn't been done since the 1954 Redskins. What to know for fantasy: Ekeler is RB3 for the season, and his 77.8 points are 3.2 more than Gordon has ever scored through the Chargers' first three games of a season. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami is the first team since the 1970 merger to be a home underdog of at least 14 points twice before the end of September. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Landon Collins makes his return to New Jersey to face his former team for the first time. He has been vocally critical of Giants general manager Dave Gettleman and the way his situation was handled, even calling him a ""liar."" Don't think for a second Collins won't want to stick it to his former team with a huge performance. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Daniel Jones' mobility will be a problem for Washington's defense. He will buy enough time to throw for 250 yards and two touchdown passes in his first home start. But Redskins quarterback Case Keenum will top him with 275 yards and three scores. -- John Keim Stat to know: The Redskins have given up more than 30 points in three consecutive games, and four straight would tie the team's single-season record, set in 1954. Meanwhile, the Giants are 8-3 with a plus-65 point differential (241-176) in their past 11 home games against Washington. What to know for fantasy: Jones was QB2 in Week 3 and now faces a Redskins defense that has allowed all three opposing quarterbacks this season to complete over 70% of their passes and throw for three scores. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past two seasons, the Giants are 1-7-1 ATS at home. Since 2017, New York is 1-3 outright as a home favorite (0-3-1 ATS). Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Rams are well aware that their offense has performed below standard. They'll attempt to get on track against the Bucs, though that could prove difficult against a Todd Bowles defense that ranks third against the run, giving up only 69.7 rushing yards per game. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Ronald Jones will notch his first career 100-yard rushing performance. He is coming off an 80-yard performance last weekend against the Giants in which he averaged 5.7 yards per carry. The Rams surrendered 128 rushing yards to Christian McCaffrey and 96 to Nick Chubb, so it's not as far-fetched as it sounds. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston leads the NFL with 10 completions into tight windows (less than one yard of separation) this season, and his 187 passing yards on such throws are the second most, according to NFL Next Gen Stats research. What to know for fantasy: Since the beginning of last season, Los Angeles' Jared Goff is averaging 83.5% more points per game at home than on the road. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Los Angeles is 7-1 ATS in its past eight games, including 3-0 this season. The team's only non-cover came in the Super Bowl. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Larry Fitzgerald hasn't had a 100-yard game against Seattle since 2017, but that could change Sunday. Fitzgerald has gotten off to his best start (18 receptions, 253 yards, two touchdowns) through three games since 2015, and it's one of the best stretches to start a season in his career. He needs five catches Sunday to move into second on the NFL's all-time receptions list. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Quinton Jefferson, who has been Seattle's best defensive lineman this season, will have pair of sacks. Kyler Murray has been sacked more times (16) than all but one quarterback, despite facing blitzes on only 24.2% of his dropbacks, which is 18th most among QBs, according to ESPN charting. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Murray has 137 pass attempts through his first three career games, the most by any player since the 1970 merger. Mike Glennon's 181 attempts is the most through a player's first four games. What to know for fantasy: Seattle's Chris Carson has lost more fumbles this season (three) than all of 2018 (two), but he is one of only two backs with a 20-plus-yard rush in all three games (Dalvin Cook is the other). See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past two seasons, Arizona is 5-0 ATS when it is an underdog of 3-7 points. Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: With a pair of sometimes-suspect quarterbacks -- Minnesota's Kirk Cousins and Chicago's Mitchell Trubisky -- the game probably hinges on which defense does a better job stopping the run. The Bears have allowed only one 100-yard rusher in regulation over their past 37 regular-season games. That player was a Viking: Latavius Murray in Week 17 of the 2017 season. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Dalvin Cook, the league's leading rusher, won't crack 100 yards rushing for the first time this season but will cross the century mark in yards from scrimmage with an increased role in the passing game. Minnesota's game plan will be predicated on short passes and screens, and we'll see Cook get his first receiving touchdown of the season. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Cook is the fifth player in NFL history to rush for 110-plus yards and a touchdown in each of his team's first three games of a season. The other four? All Hall of Famers (Jim Brown, O.J. Simpson, Emmitt Smith and Curtis Martin). What to know for fantasy: Vikings receiver Stefon Diggs has caught only six passes this season, but he did haul in 21 passes against these Bears last season. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Regarding Chicago, teams coming off victories on Monday Night Football have failed to cover seven consecutive games and are 12-20-1 ATS since 2017. Read more.",32.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Broncos are the only team to still not have a sack -- and the only team to still not have forced a turnover -- this season. The Jaguars, meanwhile, were tied for the league lead in sacks after three games, and Denver's Joe Flacco is one of only six quarterbacks who have been sacked more than 10 times in three games. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: The Jaguars will intercept Flacco at least twice. Flacco has struggled against Jacksonville overall (five touchdowns and seven interceptions, along with a 3-3 record), but it's particularly true in the past two meetings: no TD passes, four INTs and just 242 yards. The Jaguars' pass rush got cranked up last weekend (nine sacks) and might be even better than the unit Flacco played in 2017. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Jacksonville quarterback Gardner Minshew has 65 completions through 88 career pass attempts. Per Elias Sports Bureau research, he needs only six completions in his first 12 attempts in Week 4 to set the NFL record for most through 100 pass attempts. What to know for fantasy: Broncos running back Phillip Lindsay scored twice in Week 3, but he has yet to gain even 10 yards on any of his 45 carries this season. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Regarding Denver, since 2015, teams that are 0-3 are 12-2 ATS in their fourth game when playing a team that has won a game that season. Read more.",34.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Last weekend, Teddy Bridgewater proved the Saints can win without Drew Brees by relying heavily on Alvin Kamara and Michael Thomas. But the Cowboys' defense proved last season that it has the talent to shut down those guys. Dallas is the only team to keep them both at 72 yards or fewer since Kamara's first game in 2017. The Saints must find a way to create some big plays this time. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: Dak Prescott will be sacked more than two times. Why is that bold? Prescott has been sacked only twice this season. But in their past five home games dating to last season, the Saints have put up 19 sacks, including six of Houston's Deshaun Watson. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: Prescott leads the NFL in Total QBR this season at 90.4 and ranks second in passing touchdowns with nine (behind Patrick Mahomes). The only other Cowboys quarterback with nine passing TDs through three games is Don Meredith, in 1966. Prescott is completing an NFL-best 75% of his passes, up from 68% last season, thanks in part to seeing pressure on just 18% of his dropbacks, per NFL Next Gen Stats research. What to know for fantasy: So far this season, 60.1% of Kamara's points have come as a pass-catcher (65.2% in Week 3, the first game under Bridgewater). See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Bridgewater is 13-2 ATS in his career as an underdog, the best ATS mark by any quarterback with at least 10 starts as an underdog in the Super Bowl era. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Pittsburgh's offense failed to capitalize on the defense's five takeaways in Week 3. But now the Bengals are in a three-way tie with the 49ers and Dolphins for last place in the league with eight turnovers through the first three weeks. The Steelers will have another opportunity to make more defensive plays Monday, but it'll be up to the offense and quarterback Mason Rudolph to get more than a handful of points out of them. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Pittsburgh will not give up a sack. The Bengals' pass rush has been hot and cold this season, and the Steelers have given up only four sacks this season, tied for seventh fewest in the NFL and the best of any AFC team. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: The Steelers' James Conner is averaging 32.3 rushing yards per game this season after averaging almost 75 last season. Over the past two seasons, the Steelers are 1-7 when Conner rushes for 60 yards or fewer and 7-0-1 when he rushes for more than that. What to know for fantasy: Andy Dalton ranks second in passing yards this season (978), and the Steelers have given up the second-most passing yards (908). See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Mike Tomlin is 17-6 ATS in his career against Cincinnati, though Ben Roethlisberger started all of those games. Read more.",31.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Is this the week we see the training wheels come off for Teddy Bridgewater? The Saints quarterback is remarkably 2-0 as Drew Brees' replacement, but he has thrown for an average of only 185 yards per game in those two starts. That should change against a Tampa Bay team that is averaging 31 points per game and allowing 29. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: The Bucs will hold Alvin Kamara under 100 all-purpose yards and under 45 rushing yards. They have the NFL's second-ranked rushing defense, surrendering only 59.3 yards per game, and they held Christian McCaffrey to just 37 rushing yards in Week 2 (53 all-purpose yards) and the Rams to just 28 total rushing yards in Week 4. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Tampa Bay's Shaquil Barrett leads the NFL with 9.0 sacks through four games. He is the first player with nine sacks through the first four games of a season since Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila recorded nine in 2001. What to know for fantasy: Jameis Winston has thrown three-plus touchdown passes in consecutive games for the first time in his career, but now he gets a Saints team against which he has never thrown three-plus touchdown passes in a game. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Bridgewater is 25-7 against the spread (ATS) in his career as a starting quarterback, the best mark by any QB with at least 15 starts in the Super Bowl era. Read more.",49.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins top 100 receiving yards against Atlanta? After catching eight passes for 111 yards in the season opener, he has not reached 70 receiving yards in any of the past three games. The Falcons rank seventh in the NFL in passing defense per game and have allowed a receiver to top 100 receiving yards in just one of their first four games. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: The Falcons, who have been outscored 38-10 in first quarters this season, will actually have the lead after the first frame in Houston. It won't hold, though, as J.J. Watt & Co. make life miserable for the Falcons' offensive line. -- Vaughn McClure Stat to know: Texans edge rusher Whitney Mercilus now has four straight games with a sack, tied for the longest active streak in the NFL with Clay Matthews and Shaquil Barrett. His five sacks this season match the total he recorded over the previous two seasons (21 games) combined. What to know for fantasy: After scoring 11 times in his first 14 games last season, Hopkins has scored just twice in his past seven games (playoffs included). See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta has failed to cover 13 straight games against AFC opponents (1-12 outright). That includes losses to the Titans and Colts in the past two weeks. Read more.",41.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Marcus Mariota has not thrown an interception this season, but the Bills are tied with the Giants and 49ers for second in the NFL with five picks each. Tennessee adopted a quick-hitting passing attack last week to speed up Mariota's decision-making, which should be the way to go against a Bills defense that takes away the vertical passing game and is third in the league in allowing a 57.1 completion percentage. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: The Bills, who possess the NFL's fourth-best rushing attack in terms of yards per game, will run for at least 150 yards against a Titans defense that has given up a combined 146 rushing yards over its past two games. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: The Titans rank 28th in the NFL in both sacks allowed (17) and pressure rate (34.0%). They will welcome back Taylor Lewan from a four-game suspension with open arms. What to know for fantasy: Derrick Henry has nine straight games with either over 100 total yards or a rushing touchdown. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: All four Bills games have gone under the total this season. Since the start of last season, 13 of the Bills' 20 games have gone under. Read more.",27.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Can the Redskins do anything to slow the Patriots' offense? The Pats are coming off a 16-point performance in which quarterback Tom Brady completed just 18 of 39 passes for 150 yards and an interception. For the season on third downs, he's completing only 48.9% of his passes and owns a 78.0 passer rating. But he'll face a Redskins defense that, on third down, allows QBs to complete 87.2% of their throws and post a 140.5 passer rating. -- John Keim Bold prediction: New England running back James White will score two touchdowns, with his playing time rising because he's a top pass protector and the Redskins are a heavy blitz team. Also note that the Redskins enter the game ranked 29th in rushing yards allowed per game (147.5). -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: The Patriots are looking to become the first team since the 1988 Browns and Dolphins to allow zero passing touchdowns in the first five games of the season. And the Washington passing attack? Since Alex Smith got injured in Week 11 of last season, it has had an NFL-high five starting QBs. What to know for fantasy: Through four weeks, there were 44 players with at least 25 carries. Among those players, no one is averaging fewer fantasy points per touch than Sony Michel (0.44). See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: This is the 63rd straight regular-season game that Brady will be favored in, breaking a tie with Steve Young (1993-97) for the longest streak by a quarterback in the Super Bowl era. Read more.",35.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Ravens' defense has a penchant for giving up big plays. But to this point, Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph hasn't been able to take advantage of the vertical game, averaging just 3.3 air yards per completion, the lowest for any quarterback with 50 completions since 2006. To take advantage of the Ravens' weak spot, the Steelers could push Rudolph to unleash more deep throws. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Ravens rookie receiver Marquise Brown gets back on track after two lackluster games with 100 yards receiving and two long touchdown catches. The Steelers have allowed three touchdowns on passes that have traveled at least 25 yards in the air, tied for third worst in the NFL. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: JuJu Smith-Schuster's 15 receiving yards against the Bengals were the fewest he has had in a regular-season game in which he registered at least one reception. But he also has not been held under 50 receiving yards in back-to-back appearances since Weeks 11 and 13 in 2017 (he did not play in Week 12). What to know for fantasy: Pittsburgh's Diontae Johnson owns a 20.5% target share this season from Rudolph, up from his 9.7% rate with Ben Roethlisberger under center. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Baltimore has covered each of the past five meetings in Pittsburgh. Read more.",41.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Khalil Mack will be looking to take over the game against his former teammates. Unless, of course, two guys who never played with Mack in Oakland -- right tackle Trent Brown, whom the Raiders feted with a four-year, $66 million contract, and left tackle Kolton Miller, the Raiders' first-round pick a year ago -- have something to say about it and keep quarterback Derek Carr clean. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Bears rookie running back David Montgomery finally breaks through with 100 rushing yards. Chicago head coach Matt Nagy is high on veteran backup quarterback Chase Daniel, who's starting in place of Mitchell Trubisky (left shoulder), but Nagy still wants to control the clock and pound the ball with Montgomery. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Oakland's Darren Waller enters play with 33 receptions, tied for the most by a tight end through the first four games in NFL history (Antonio Gates, 2007). He needs nine receptions on Sunday to break the five-game record, held by Zach Ertz (2018) and Eric Johnson (2004). What to know for fantasy: The Raiders' Tyrell Williams is the only player with a touchdown reception in all four weeks thus far and has seen five of Oakland's six end zone targets this season. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: In the past six London games, favorites are 5-1 ATS, and five of the six games went under the total. Read more.",30.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How will Kirk Cousins perform vs. the Giants' 25th-ranked pass defense, which is allowing 279.5 yards per game. The Vikings' passing game has been bad (169.0 yards per game), prompting receiver Adam Thielen to express his frustrations and, in turn, Cousins to apologize. This should be a prime spot for them to get on track, even with the uncertainty surrounding receiver Stefon Diggs. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Minnesota will bench Diggs in Week 5 to send a message to the star receiver, especially after he missed practice for non-football injury-related reasons earlier in the week. The last thing the Vikings need is for Diggs' situation to blow up into a full-blown distraction. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Daniel Jones needs two passing touchdowns and 72 passing yards to have the most in each category by a Giants quarterback in his first three NFL starts since the 1970 merger. What to know for fantasy: Dalvin Cook has rushed for a touchdown in all four weeks this season and has seen his reception total increase each week as he continues to make a bid as a top-tier fantasy RB. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota is 22-10-1 ATS after a loss under Mike Zimmer. Read more.",39.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Eagles are paper-thin at cornerback after injuries to Ronald Darby and Avonte Maddox. Sidney Jones (hamstring) has practiced this week in hopes of playing. This is a matchup of the worst passing offense in the NFL (Jets, 131 yards per game) vs. the worst passing defense (324 yards per game). -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: With quarterback Sam Darnold (mono) sidelined for a third straight game, the Jets' epic struggles on offense will continue. They've gone 21 straight possessions without a score, and that number will reach the high 20s. The Eagles' pass defense is vulnerable, but Luke Falk -- a dink-and-dunk passer -- doesn't have enough arm to exploit the matchup. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: The Eagles' Carson Wentz has 963 passing yards on the season, and he needs 400 more to have his most through the first five games of a season in his career (his single-game career high is 364). What to know for fantasy: Zach Ertz finished last season as TE2 despite not scoring his first touchdown until Week 5. Ertz has not scored this season, but his 24 catches rank fourth at the position this season and keep his floor high. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Philadelphia is 10-0 all time against New York and 9-1 ATS. That's tied for the most outright wins without a loss in any matchup in NFL history, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. Read more.",41.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Both teams will be relying on top running backs from the 2017 draft to take the pressure off young quarterbacks. Christian McCaffrey, the eighth pick, leads the NFL in rushing with 411 yards, and Jacksonville's Leonard Fournette, the fourth pick, isn't far behind with 404. The team that gets the running game going will have a decisive advantage. -- David Newton Bold prediction: McCaffrey surpasses 100 yards rushing and receiving. He's a bad matchup for the Jaguars because they've had issues covering backs out of the backfield. The Jags likely won't have cornerback Jalen Ramsey, and the domino effect of his absence will be a major issue when McCaffrey lines up on the outside. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Jacksonville receiver DJ Chark Jr. has 19 receptions for 321 yards and three scores this season. He had just 14 receptions for 174 yards and zero TDs in 11 games last season. What to know for fantasy: Curtis Samuel's target share is nearly twice that of DJ Moore (24.1% to 12.1%) with Kyle Allen under center for the Panthers this season. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Both Allen and Gardner Minshew II are 3-0 ATS in their careers as starters. Read more.",35.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The game between winless teams could feature multiple sacks. The Cardinals have allowed a league-high 20 sacks; the Bengals are right behind them at 19. This one could be decided by which quarterback is upright at the end of the afternoon. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: The Cardinals' passing game will finally lead them to a win. The Bengals are allowing 8.6 yards per attempt, which is ideal for a team averaging 5.5 despite having Kyler Murray -- who has thrown for 300 yards in two of his first four games. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: Cincinnati's Joe Mixon is averaging a career-low 3.2 yards per rush and 37.3 yards per game this season. The Bengals as a whole have an NFL-worst 2.8 yards per rush and NFL-low 1.5 yards before first contact. What to know for fantasy: Murray leads the NFL with 187 opportunities this season (pass-plus-rush attempts). See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Since the start of the 2016 season, Arizona is 3-13 ATS in 1 p.m. ET games. Read more.",41.0,LOW
" What to watch for: With Denver desperate for a win and fellow edge rusher Bradley Chubb done for the year because of an ACL injury, look for Von Miller to ignite the Broncos by getting after Philip Rivers, who has limited mobility. ""His quickness with power is awesome,"" said Rivers about Miller, who has 16 career sacks against the Chargers. ""That's why he's one of the best [defensive] ends/outside 'backers ever."" -- Eric D. Williams Bold prediction: The Broncos have not intercepted a pass this season, but they will get their first one Sunday. The Chargers are 2-6 when the Broncos have intercepted Rivers at least twice and 5-11 when Denver has intercepted him at least once. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Chargers receiver Keenan Allen leads the NFL with 452 receiving yards, and he is the only player with more than 400. He is seeing the most targets per route run (32.4%) among wide receivers this season. What to know for fantasy: Broncos receiver Courtland Sutton is on pace for 88 catches, 1,236 receiving yards and eight touchdowns. That stat line would be worth 259.6 points, not much different from the 260.1 points that Allen produced last season. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: The Broncos are 1-7 ATS in their past eight games. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Can the Packers' defense replicate what New Orleans did a week ago in holding Ezekiel Elliott to 35 yards on 18 carries? The Cowboys will want to prove last week was more of a fluke than a trend. In three games against the Packers, including playoffs, Elliott has run for 157, 125 and 116 yards on 79 carries. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: The first team to 30 rushing attempts will win. Elliott is coming off the third-fewest rushing yards of his career, yet the Packers are allowing 142.3 yards per game and 5.0 yards per carry. On the flip side, the Packers might have to run the ball with Aaron Jones given the turf toe injury to Davante Adams, who caught two touchdown passes in the previous meeting in Dallas. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: According to NFL Next Gen Stats data, Aaron Rodgers ranked first in completion percentage into tight windows in 2016. But since 2017, his 29% completion rate ranks 38th out of 43 passers with at least 50 such attempts. What to know for fantasy: Dallas' Amari Cooper is on pace for a career-high 84 catches and has scored four times in four games this season. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Both times Rodgers faced the Cowboys in Dallas, Green Bay won the game outright as an underdog (2016 divisional round and 2017 Week 5). Read more.",49.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Chiefs' defense allows a touchdown or a field goal on an alarming 43% of their defensive possessions, 25th in the league. The Colts, meanwhile, are scoring on 40% of their possessions, 11th best. Indianapolis' offensive efficiency might be a good match for Kansas City's offensive power. But can the Colts keep possession effectively enough to pull the upset? -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Nope. Not super bold, but scoring even just a little over 30 points will be enough for the Chiefs to win. Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has led the Colts to more than 30 points in a game only once in 19 starts, and that was 31 points in his second start back in Week 3 of the 2017 season. The Chiefs, averaging 33.8 points per game, have scored more than 30 points with quarterback Patrick Mahomes as the starter 13 times in his 20 career starts. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: Chiefs running back LeSean McCoy has three scrimmage touchdowns this season, matching his total in 14 games last season. The Chiefs are averaging 5.2 yards per rush this season with McCoy on the field, compared to 3.3 with him off the field. For context, 5.2 yards per rush with McCoy on the field would rank fifth in the NFL among all teams this season, as opposed to 27th when McCoy isn't on the field. What to know for fantasy: Receiver Sammy Watkins scored 46.8 points in Week 1, but that is 18.1 more fantasy points than he has scored in the three weeks since. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: This game has the highest over/under this season. Since 2011, games with totals of 55 or higher are 33-22-1 to the over. Read more.",63.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The 49ers are missing left tackle Joe Staley and cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon, both of whom play positions opposite Cleveland's best players in defensive end Myles Garrett (and DE/LB Olivier Vernon, depending on alignment) and receiver Odell Beckham Jr. With backups in the lineup, can the Niners neutralize two of Cleveland's biggest stars? -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: Cleveland running back Nick Chubb rushes for more than 100 yards against San Francisco's No. 1-ranked run defense to power the Browns to their second win on Monday Night Football this season. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: The Niners' Jeff Wilson Jr. has scored multiple rushing touchdowns in two straight games. No 49ers player has done that in three straight games since Billy Kilmer in 1961. What to know for fantasy: Baker Mayfield averaged one touchdown pass every 18 attempts as a rookie. That number is down to once every 34.8 passes this season, and he ranks as QB23 through Week 4. See Week 5 rankings.

" What to watch for: The Chiefs scored 13 points, by far their lowest total with Patrick Mahomes as their starting quarterback, last weekend in a loss to the Colts, while the Texans hung 53 on the Falcons. So it will be interesting to see whether the Chiefs can bounce back despite potentially being without two injured starting offensive linemen and wide receiver Sammy Watkins. The Texans, who are 12th in the league in scoring defense allowing 22 points per game, offer a significant challenge. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Mahomes and Deshaun Watson will combine for 750 passing yards. This game will be about the offense, and we'll see big games from two of the NFL's best young quarterbacks, who almost combined to surpass that total in each of their Week 5 games. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: The Chiefs are allowing 155.8 rushing yards per game this season, which is the third-worst in the NFL and the most for Kansas City through five games since 2008. The Texans acquired Carlos Hyde via trade with the Chiefs prior to the regular season, and his 310 rushing yards this season ranks 15th among running backs. What to know for fantasy: In Week 5, Will Fuller doubled his catch total for the season and jumped up 58 spots in the wide receiver fantasy ranks. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Watson is 8-1 ATS in his career as a road underdog, with four outright wins. Read more.",65.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Eagles are coming off a 10-sack performance, while the Vikings harassed Giants quarterback Daniel Jones last weekend with aggressive blitzes. Philadelphia scheming to stop Dalvin Cook and the run while Minnesota's pass rush aims to force Carson Wentz into a tough spot is a matchup of two stalwarts. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Vikings receivers Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs will be happier with the direction of the offense under QB Kirk Cousins after this one. They will combine for 160 yards and a pair of touchdowns against a patchwork Eagles secondary. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Wentz has gone four consecutive games with a completion percentage south of 60%, the longest active streak in the NFL and the longest by an Eagles starting quarterback since Mike McMahon went seven straight starts in 2005. What to know for fantasy: Minnesota's Cook has had at least 20 touches in every game this season and is on pace for 362. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Mike Zimmer is 31-12-1 ATS at home as the Vikings' coach, the best ATS percentage by any coach in the Super Bowl era (minimum 25 games). And he is 2-0 this season.

" What to watch for: Expect Saints pass-rushers Marcus Davenport and Cameron Jordan to be in the face of Jaguars quarterback Gardner Minshew. The rookie is tied for the NFL lead with seven total fumbles and four lost fumbles -- three of which happened last weekend -- and the majority have come when he's been sacked or scrambling to avoid a sack. Davenport and Jordan have combined for six sacks and two forced fumbles. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: Jacksonville's Leonard Fournette will snap the Saints' streak of 31 games without allowing a 100-yard rusher, including the playoffs -- the longest active streak in the NFL. The Saints' front seven is playing great, and will make Fournette work for it. But he has 333 yards over the past two games. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: New Orleans running back Alvin Kamara has been held under 70 rushing yards for four consecutive games. He is averaging 3.95 yards per rush over his past four games after rushing for 97 yards (7.46 per rush) in Week 1. What to know for fantasy: DJ Chark was drafted in just 11.8% of fantasy leagues. Yet through five weeks, he has the same number of fantasy points (105.5) as Brandin Cooks and Stefon Diggs combined. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Teddy Bridgewater is 26-7 ATS in his career as a starting quarterback, the best mark by any quarterback with at least 15 starts in the Super Bowl era. He's 14-2 ATS in his career as an underdog (7-9 outright). Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Russell Wilson has been fabulous this season, with 14 total touchdowns and no interceptions. Can a banged-up Cleveland secondary finally force him into turnovers? If not, it could be another long day for the Browns. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny will combine for at least 150 yards on the ground, which is about what Cleveland's 29th-ranked rush defense is allowing per game. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: According to NFL Next Gen Stats data, Seahawks receivers are producing 3.8 yards of average separation when targeted this season, best in the NFL. They have been considered open -- three or more yards of separation at arrival of the throw -- on 55% of their targets, also the highest mark in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Wilson leads the league in touchdown pass percentage (7.7%) and is in search of his third straight season finishing as a top-three player in that metric. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Seattle played last Thursday, while Cleveland played Monday. Since 2015, teams coming off Thursday games are 10-3 ATS against teams coming off Monday games. Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Baltimore averages 36 runs per game, a monumental challenge for Cincinnati, which has given up the second-most rushing yards this season (167.6 per game). -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: With that in mind, the Ravens will have at least 250 rushing yards. This is a bad matchup for the Bengals, who have allowed 250 rushing yards or more in two of the first five games this season. Baltimore running back Mark Ingram and quarterback Lamar Jackson each has more than 300 rushing yards this season. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Jackson has a 68.4 QBR when pressured this season, the second-best in the league (minimum 20 action plays). But Andy Dalton is second-worst in that category (0.9 QBR). What to know for fantasy: Tyler Boyd ranks fourth in the NFL with 53 targets and is playing for a Bengals team that is dropping back to pass at the third-highest rate (71%). See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: The Ravens are 32-0 as a double-digit favorite, making them the only active franchise to never lose as a double-digit favorite. However, since 2010, they are just 3-10 ATS in those games. Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Washington has the NFL's sixth-worst rushing offense, averaging 69 yards per game. Miami is the NFL's worst run defense at 176 yards per game. Washington interim coach Bill Callahan is a big ""establish the run"" guy, so we've got a team that can't run but wants to versus a team that can't stop the run but knows it needs to do so. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: With Callahan stressing commitment to the running game, the Redskins will run the ball 40 times -- their highest total since the season opener in 2018. The Dolphins will keep the Redskins under their per-game average, but Adrian Peterson will rush for a season-best 80 yards. -- John Keim Stat to know: The 0.0 FPI matchup quality -- on a 0-100 scale -- is the worst of any game measured since it was first tracked in 2008. This marks the sixth game in the Super Bowl era between teams with a combined record of 0-9 or worse, and the first since 2004. The Dolphins and Redskins are the only two teams in the NFL that rank in the bottom five in both offensive and defensive efficiency. What to know for fantasy: In a matchup of two of the worst teams in terms of offensive snaps with a lead this season, it's worth noting that Terry McLaurin has been targeted four times when Washington was leading and turned it into three catches for 104 yards and a touchdown. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Washington is the second team 0-5 or worse to be listed as a road favorite in the Super Bowl era, joining another Redskins team in 1998 (-2.5 at Philadelphia, lost 17-12). Read more.",41.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The ground game will be crucial. The 49ers boast the top rushing offense in the NFL, averaging 200 yards per game. That could spell trouble for a Rams defense that ranks 15th at stopping the run (107 yards per game). On the flip side, the Rams average 96 yards, and the 49ers' front has been among the best in allowing only 82 per game. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay are known for their offensive acumen, and these teams average a combined 61 points per game. But both sides have injuries and questions marks dotting their offensive depth charts. The over/under for this one is set for 50.5. It'll go under. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: Twelve running backs in the NFL have had at least 20 rushes and are averaging over 5 yards per rush, and the 49ers have three of them in Matt Breida (6.5), Raheem Mostert (5.8) and Tevin Coleman (5.5). Yet the only 49ers player with multiple rushing touchdowns this season is Jeff Wilson Jr. (four), who averages 2.9 yards per rush. What to know for fantasy: The Rams' Cooper Kupp is seeking to become the first player in NFL history with four consecutive games of at least nine catches and a receiving score. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Underdogs with 4-0 or better records are 15-8-1 ATS since 2003, and 4-0 ATS since 2015. Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Cardinals figured out how running the ball can lead to victory. Sure, it was against the Bengals, but a win is still a win. Watch for Arizona to repeat that run-first game plan against Atlanta, even if David Johnson is either slowed or doesn't play due to back issues. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Devonta Freeman will have his first 100-yard rushing game of the season and more than 20 carries as the Falcons finally achieve the balance they've been seeking. -- Vaughn McClure Stat to know: Matt Ryan has 300 passing yards in every game this season, and he could join Kurt Warner and Steve Young as only players with 300 in each of their teams' first six games in the Super Bowl era (Patrick Mahomes could also do so this weekend). But the Falcons will also be trying to avoid their worst six-game start since 2007 (1-5), the season before they drafted Ryan. What to know for fantasy: Kyler Murray had just 17 total rushing yards in his first two career games, but he's racked up at least 27 in each of the three games since, and his 16-game pace over those three games is that of a 1,000-yard rusher. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past two seasons, Atlanta is 6-15 ATS, the worst record in the NFL. That includes 2-9 ATS on the road and 3-12 ATS in non-division games. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Noah Fant and Jeff Heuerman should be targeted a lot. The Titans have surrendered eight touchdowns in the passing game this season, and four of those have been to opposing tight ends. They also have surrendered one 100-yard receiving game this season, also to an opposing tight end. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Derrick Henry will rush for more than 100 yards and have two touchdowns. Denver's defense is 22nd against the run (126.4 yards per game), a prime spot for the Titans and Henry to get back to their smashmouth style of offense. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Titans are the only team that has yet to see an offensive drive end in a turnover this season. And the Broncos' defense is tied for the second-fewest takeaways in the NFL this season (three, all in Week 5). What to know for fantasy: Courtland Sutton is a top-10 receiver in terms of fantasy points per catch with 3.23 (minimum 20 catches). That rate ranks ahead of Brandin Cooks, T.Y. Hilton and, even after the historic Week 5, Will Fuller. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: The underdog has won all five Tennessee games this season outright. Read more.",37.5,LOW
" What to watch for: It's the No. 1-ranked offense and a two-game losing streak versus the No. 32 offense and a four-game losing streak. Sam Darnold's return from mono will help the Jets out of their offensive funk, but the Cowboys have too many playmakers on both sides of the ball for this to be close. By the fourth quarter, it could be a two-touchdown game and the stadium will be overrun by Dallas fans. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: Ezekiel Elliott will have 20 or more carries after three consecutive games without reaching that number. He never has gone four straight games in his career without reaching 20 attempts. In their past three games vs. a Gregg Williams-led defense, the Cowboys have averaged 137 yards on the ground and had six rushing touchdowns. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: The Cowboys' defense allows a third-down conversion just 26% of the time, second-best in the league -- and the Jets' offense converts only 21% of its third downs, the worst in NFL this season. What to know for fantasy: Amari Cooper is coming off a career-high 226 receiving yards against the Packers, but in the game following his other two career 200-plus-yard contests, he has averaged just 40 receiving yards. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Dak Prescott is 7-2-1 ATS in his career when favored by six or more points (10-0 outright). He is also 13-5-2 ATS when facing teams that enter with losing records. Read more.",38.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Chargers are allowing 120 rushing yards per game this season, No. 18 in the NFL, and have given up more than 190 rushing yards in a game twice. So will the Steelers lean on James Conner and the running game to help protect rookie quarterback Devlin Hodges? They average just 67 rushing yards per contest, 28th in the NFL. -- Eric D. Williams Bold prediction: JuJu Smith-Schuster will have his first 100-yard receiving game this season. The Chargers have one of the better pass defenses in the league, but third-string QB Hodges isn't afraid to throw the ball. Smith-Schuster is looking for redemption after fumbling away a chance to win last weekend's game against Baltimore in overtime. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: Melvin Gordon gained just 31 yards on 12 rushes in last weekend's season debut, but he hasn't been held under 40 rushing yards in consecutive weeks since 2016 Weeks 3-4. What to know for fantasy: Conner has yet to deliver more than 55 rushing yards in a game this season, but he is facing a Chargers team that gave up 174 yards on 25 carries to Indianapolis' Marlon Mack and 114 on Phillip Lindsay's 15 totes for Denver earlier this season. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Quarterbacks making their first career starts are 7-0 ATS this season. Read more.",41.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Aaron Rodgers hasn't had one of those Aaron Rodgers games yet this season, the kind when he just shreds a defense. But the Lions could be just what Rodgers needs. They rank 30th in the NFL in passing defense, allowing 280.8 yards per game. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Kerryon Johnson gains more than 100 yards and scores two touchdowns -- one rushing and one receiving -- to lead the Lions to their third consecutive victory at Lambeau Field. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: The Lions blitz 9.1% of the time, the lowest percentage by a team this season and the lowest since 2006 when that data became available. And according to ESPN pass-rush metrics powered by NFL Next Gen Stats, the Lions are last in the NFL in pass rush win rate, beating their blocks within 2.5 seconds just 29% of the time. The Packers, meanwhile, have the eighth-best pass block win rate in the NFL (60%). What to know for fantasy: Marvin Jones has scored six touchdowns in five games against the Packers since joining the Lions in 2016. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Detroit has won and covered all four meetings between these two teams in the past two seasons, including three times as an underdog. Prior to that, Detroit had been 4-18 straight up and 6-16 ATS in its previous 22 meetings against Green Bay. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Shaquil Barrett likely won't be rendered sackless two weeks in a row, especially against the team that allowed him three sacks in one quarter in Week 2. The Bucs also will have a healthy Devin White, who suffered a sprained MCL on the Panthers' opening series in Week 2 and missed three games, giving them an extra run-stopper to slow Christian McCaffrey. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: McCaffrey will top 175 all-purpose yards for the fifth time in six games. OK, when it's put that way, it might not sound bold, but the one time he didn't reach that total this season came against Tampa Bay, which held him to a season-low 53 yards from scrimmage. -- David Newton Stat to know: The Panthers' defense allows just 5.95 yards per pass attempt, third fewest in the NFL, and a 42.3 QBR (fifth lowest). But it has been susceptible against the run, allowing 4.87 yards per rush, the seventh most among all teams. And the Buccaneers pass on just 60.2% of plays, the 20th-highest rate in the league. What to know for fantasy: Bucs receiver Chris Godwin has finished three weeks as a top-10 receiver this season, while teammate Mike Evans has finished outside of the top 45 on three occasions. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Carolina is 4-0 outright and against the spread (ATS) in Kyle Allen starts, including 3-0 this season. In the past 10 seasons, the only quarterback to start his career 5-0 outright and ATS is Patrick Mahomes. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Texans hold off the Colts' pass rush? The Colts have sacked Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson 15 times in three meetings, including the playoffs last season. They also sacked Patrick Mahomes, who has somewhat of a similar playing style to Watson, four times in a Week 5 meeting with Kansas City. Watson has been sacked 18 times in six games this season. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: On that note, Watson is sacked five or more times. He was not sacked in either of his past two games, but the Colts have had success with their pass rush against him in the past. Houston's offensive line had improved, but now it has a new right tackle after Tytus Howard partially tore the MCL in his left knee against the Chiefs. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: Houston running back Carlos Hyde put up 116 rushing yards in last week's win over the Chiefs but has never had consecutive 100-yard rushing games in his NFL career. And despite only running the ball by design 38% of the time (15th highest in the NFL this season), the Texans have the NFL's fifth-best rushing offense, averaging 139.8 yards per game. What to know for fantasy: Indianapolis' T.Y. Hilton has been a top-four receiver in his previous two games at Houston -- but outside the top 25 at the position in his past two home games against the Texans. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Watson is 10-2 against the spread (ATS) in his career as an underdog (6-6 outright). Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Vikings should focus on the ground game again, as Dalvin Cook looks to take advantage of a Lions defense that has given up at least 100 yards rushing every week. Cook could be in line for a monster day, perhaps as big as 150 yards and a touchdown or two. How Detroit handles Cook could be the key to a win or loss. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford will be sacked at least six times. Yes, his offensive line is better than last year, and yes, he's  been sacked only 10 times in five games and is averaging a career-best 8 yards gained per pass attempt. But it's going to be another long day for the 11-year veteran QB against the Vikings defense, given he has few options for a quick out and not much to work with in the passing game beyond receiver Kenny Golladay. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: According to NFL Next Gen Stats, Minnesota QB Kirk Cousins has averaged 2.98 seconds to throw this season, the most in the NFL. The Lions have allowed opponents 2.99 seconds to throw this season, highest in the NFL, in part because they blitz on a league-low 9% of dropbacks. What to know for fantasy: Cook and Christian McCaffrey are the only running backs this season with five games of at least 19 fantasy points. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota is 0-6 ATS with Cousins in games where the line is at or within three points. Read more.",37.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Since the defense still hasn't figured out how to stop opponents on a consistent basis, the Falcons have to rely on their high-powered offense, which has surpassed 30 points the past two games even in defeat. A possible Julio Jones-Jalen Ramsey matchup could be fun, but the Falcons should be able to score regardless. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Jones, Calvin Ridley and Mohamed Sanu will all have big days for the Falcons. The Rams receive a boost with the acquisition of Ramsey, though it's uncertain how much he will play. But even a trio of Atlanta receivers stacking yards won't be quite enough to defeat the defending NFC champions. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: The Rams' Cooper Kupp has 100 receiving yards in four games this season. Since 2006, only one Rams receiver has had five 100-yard receiving games in a season (Brandin Cooks, five in 2018). What to know for fantasy: Atlanta's Matt Ryan is the only quarterback this season with four games of 300 passing yards and three passing touchdowns. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past two seasons, Atlanta is 6-16 ATS, the worst record in the NFL. It has failed to cover in four straight games and is 1-5 ATS this season, tied with Washington for worst in the NFL. Read more.",57.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Which defensive front controls the game may determine who wins. The Packers' pass rush, fueled by Preston Smith and Za'Darius Smith, has combined for 13 sacks this season. The Smiths combined for 2.5 sacks in Monday night's win against the Lions alone, and half of their season sacks have come on third-down plays. But the Raiders have allowed just eight sacks this season, fifth fewest in the league entering Week 7. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Raiders running back Josh Jacobs will set the tone early with a ground-and-pound attack that would make even Vince Lombardi smile, and he will finish with his second straight 100-plus-yard rushing day after going for 126 against the Bears in London two weeks ago. The Packers are giving up 124.5 yards per game on the ground, and the Raiders, sans a true No. 1 receiver, are transitioning into a smash-mouth-type offense. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers has 23 wins against AFC opponents since the 2010 season, the most by any NFC quarterback. The Packers are also 15-4 at home against AFC teams since 2010, and have won three in a row. What to know for fantasy: Raiders tight end Darren Waller has yet to score on his 42 targets. The other nine top-10 tight ends this season are scoring once every 20 targets. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Since 2014, teams coming off a bye (Oakland) are just 2-7-1 ATS against teams coming off a Monday game (Green Bay). And since 1990, those teams are just 13-26-2 ATS. Read more.",50.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It'll be a lot of rushing plays. The Redskins will try to run the ball against a defense that ranks 11th in yards per carry allowed. And despite the Niners playing only five games, just one team has rushed more times than them this season (Baltimore), and they will face a defense that ranks 28th in total rushing yards allowed and 23rd in yards per carry. Coach Kyle Shanahan's revenge game will be won on the ground. -- John Keim Bold prediction: The Redskins will not score a touchdown. Washington is 30th in the league in points per game (15), and San Francisco's defense is second in points allowed per game (12.8). The Niners' defense is rolling, the Redskins' offense is struggling, and it's going to be hard for Washington to break through. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: The 49ers have allowed the fewest passing yards per game this season (150.2) and the lowest opposing Total QBR (15.7). They have allowed just five total touchdowns, and opponents are scoring points on just 58% of red zone trips (second in the NFL behind the Patriots). Oh, and they have yet to allow a running back to rush for 100 yards this season. What to know for fantasy: Matt Breida's catch count has increased with each game this season, a nice trend to have for a running back averaging 5.8 yards per carry this season. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Washington has lost seven straight home games, going 1-6 ATS in that span and 0-3 ATS this season. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bills have yet to employ an offense that includes both Devin Singletary and Duke Williams, each of whom offers a dynamic element. Look for offensive coordinator Brian Daboll to get creative with his new-look offense against the Dolphins' barely-there defense. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: To that point, the Bills rush for 250-plus yards. The Dolphins have the NFL's second-worst run defense, allowing 170 yards per game. The game plan should be easy for Buffalo: Attack Miami where it hurts. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: After last week's win against the Redskins, FPI is giving the Dolphins an 88.5% chance to get the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NFL draft. The next-highest chance belongs to the Bengals ... at 7%. What to know for fantasy: Buffalo's Josh Allen threw five touchdown passes last season against the Dolphins (59 attempts) and five against the rest of the NFL (261 attempts). See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami is the second team since the 1970 merger to be an underdog of at least 14 points in four of its first six games of a season (1977 Seattle). Read more.",39.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The winless Bengals are down to a fourth-string left tackle and have the worst rushing defense in the league. Jacksonville, on the other hand, has Leonard Fournette and a pass rush led by rookie Josh Allen, who already has four sacks this season. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: Fournette will rush for 150 yards and two touchdowns. The Bengals are last in the NFL in rushing yards allowed (184.5 per game) and yards per carry (5.3), and the Jaguars are going to try to exploit that weakness, especially with rookie QB Gardner Minshew II coming off his worst game of the season. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Jacksonville's DJ Chark Jr. has 528 receiving yards (third in the NFL), and his five receiving touchdowns are tied for second both in the NFL this season and in Jaguars history through the team's first six games. What to know for fantasy: The Bengals' Auden Tate has seen 34 targets over the past four weeks, 13th most in the NFL over that stretch. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Teams 0-4 or worse (Cincinnati) are 13-29-1 ATS as home underdogs since 2009. Read more.",31.0,LOW
" What to watch for: It's time for Kyler Murray vs. Daniel Jones. It will be just the eighth time in 49 years there has been a matchup of top-10-pick rookie quarterbacks. Murray was No. 1 overall this year, and Jones went No. 6. So far this season, Murray has averaged 277 passing yards per game, while Jones has averaged 230. Jones has also turned the ball over more frequently. It will be interesting to see how they stack up against each other on the same field against subpar defenses. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Murray will throw for 450 yards. He finished with 340 against the Falcons on Sunday for his third 300-yard game this season. Against the Giants, Murray will be facing a defense that allows 285 passing yards per game, second most in the NFL. That's just asking Murray, who's shown weekly growth and development, to put up huge numbers. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: The Giants own the NFL's worst turnover total this season at 15, including five games with multiple giveaways. They had 19 turnovers for the entire 2018 season. What to know for fantasy: Murray has more rushing attempts in October (21) than he did in September (18) and completed a season-high 73% of his passes last week against the Falcons. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: New York is 2-8-1 ATS at home over the past two seasons. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: All eyes will be on quarterback Ryan Tannehill as he makes his first start for the Titans. The focus will be on whether Tannehill is decisive with the football and whether it keeps him from getting sacked. He should look to get the ball out quickly to the receivers so they can make plays. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Chargers running back Melvin Gordon rushes for more than 100 yards. He has been held to just 49 rushing yards through two games since his return from a holdout, but the last time he played against Tennessee, Gordon totaled a career-high 196 rushing yards in 2016. -- Eric D. Williams Stat to know: The Titans have gone 18 straight games without 300 passing yards, the second-longest active streak in the NFL (Bills, 38). What to know for fantasy: Gordon has 10.7 points as a pass-catcher compared to just 4.9 points as a ball carrier this season, and none of his 20 carries have gained more than 7 yards. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Tennessee is 0-3 outright this season as a favorite. All three games went under, as Tennessee averaged 10.3 points per game. Read more.",35.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky is expected to return from a left shoulder injury, but can he breathe life into Chicago's stale offense? The numbers say no. The Bears rank near the bottom of the league in virtually every important offensive statistical category, and that's after Trubisky's backup, Chase Daniel, strung together two decent outings before Chicago's bye week. The Saints defense seems like a bad matchup for Trubisky. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Saints right tackle Ryan Ramczyk will allow his first sack of the season to Khalil Mack (who splits time evenly on the left and right sides). Ramczyk, a second-team All-Pro last season, has pitched a shutout so far this year despite lining up against the likes of J.J. Watt and DeMarcus Lawrence. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Michael Thomas leads the NFL with 53 receptions, eight more than any other player entering Week 7. He is the only player in NFL history with multiple seasons of 50 receptions through six games (also 53 through six games last season). What to know for fantasy: Allen Robinson II is one of just four receivers to have seven catches and 75 receiving yards in each of his past two games heading into Week 7 (Thomas, Chris Godwin and Julian Edelman are the others). See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: New Orleans is 4-0 this season in Teddy Bridgewater starts. Bridgewater is 27-7 ATS overall and 15-2 ATS as an underdog in his career. Both are the best by any quarterback in the Super Bowl era (minimum 15 starts). Read more.",29.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Can Russell Wilson continue his scorching start against Earl Thomas III, Marcus Peters and the Ravens' secondary? And what kind of reaction will Thomas get at CenturyLink Field given how much he meant to the Seahawks during his nine seasons in Seattle but also how poorly that relationship ended last season? It's shaping up as an exciting showdown in Seattle. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Wilson throws for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns, taking advantage of Baltimore's aggressiveness. The Ravens blitz at the highest rate in the NFL (45%), but Wilson completes a league-best 73% of his passes against the blitz. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: Wilson has posted 14 passing touchdowns, a 73% completion percentage, 9.0 yards per attempt and an 80 Total QBR -- all bests for his career through six games. Helping him to those numbers, Seahawks receivers have been ""wide open"" -- 5 yards of separation at arrival of the throw -- on 31% of their targets this season, the highest mark in the NFL, per NFL Next Gen Stats. What to know for fantasy: Baltimore's Lamar Jackson would have been RB9 last week if he was a running back and only his rushing stats counted (152 yards and a touchdown). See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Baltimore is 0-4-1 ATS in five games this season since beating Miami 59-10 in Week 1. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Cowboys get off to a fast start? In their three-game losing streak, they have been outscored 47-9 in the first half. In their past two games, they have trailed by 28 and 18 points. To make a comeback under those circumstances, things have to go perfectly. They haven't. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Dallas' Dak Prescott will be forced into a pair of turnovers that will prove to be the difference in the game, as the combination of an ailing Cowboys offensive line and the return of corner Jalen Mills sparks the Eagles' defense. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: The Cowboys used play-action on 34% of their pass attempts over the first three weeks of the season, but that has fallen to 17% over the past three weeks. And when running play-action, Prescott has seen his yards per attempt fall from 12.1 to 7.6, his completion percentage drop from 81% to 70%, and a 4-to-1 TD-INT ratio plummet to 0-to-2. What to know for fantasy: Philadelphia's Zach Ertz is one of three players in the NFL with at least 50 receiving yards in each of the first six weeks of the season. That said, he is not one of the 96 players with a 75-plus-yard receiving game this season. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Dallas has lost three straight games, all as a favorite, for the first time since 1979. It has not lost four straight games, all as a favorite, since 1974. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Jets' blitz schemes will cause problems for Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who has struggled the past three weeks when throwing under pressure. That will be enough to keep the game close, but the Jets will have major issues with New England's man-to-man coverage schemes and won't be able to keep up offensively. Sam Darnold will learn a hard lesson about quarterbacking against a Bill Belichick-coached defense. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: Undrafted free-agent wide receiver Jakobi Meyers will record his first career touchdown pass. The Patriots project to lean more on Meyers with Josh Gordon (knee) ailing and Phillip Dorsett II (hamstring) hoping to return after having missed the Week 6 win over the Giants. Testing the Jets' depth at cornerback figures to be part of the Patriots' plan. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: In his past three games, Brady has been pressured 24% of the time, which is up from 15% in his first three games. When pressured this season, he is completing just 24% of his passes (third worst in the NFL), is averaging only 2.5 yards per attempt and has two interceptions. The Jets blitz on 38% of opponent QB dropbacks, which is the fourth-highest rate in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: In Darnold's return to action in Week 6, Robby Anderson scored 23.5 points, 4.7 points more than he scored during the three games he played without Darnold. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: New York has covered five of the past six home meetings between these two, though it failed to cover last season with Josh McCown at quarterback.

" What to watch for: Keep an eye on how Ryan Tannehill and the Titans' receivers do against the Bucs' defense, which is giving up an NFL-worst 304.5 passing yards per game. Tennessee will need to score points against the Bucs, who have scored 24 or more themselves in four consecutive games. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston will throw two interceptions, while Tannehill will throw for 300 yards in consecutive weeks for the first time since 2016. Winston is coming off one of the worst outings of his career, throwing five interceptions against the Panthers and turning the ball over six times. The Titans have an opportunistic secondary that gets its hands on a lot of passes -- that's not a great recipe for a bounce-back game. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Tampa Bay's Chris Godwin has posted 125 receiving yards in three straight games, the longest streak in Buccaneers history. The last player in the NFL to do it in four straight games was Odell Beckham Jr. in 2014. What to know for fantasy: No player has more than 68 rushing yards this season against Tampa Bay, and that includes two games of Christian McCaffrey. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Tennessee is 0-4-1 against the spread (ATS) this season when the line is between +3 and -3. The only time it pushed was last week when the Chargers fumbled at the 1-yard line down by three with under a minute left. Read more.",49.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can Mitchell Trubisky move the ball through the air against a vulnerable Chargers pass defense? He is 29th out of 31 eligible quarterbacks in Total QBR (34.3) and is averaging just 5.2 yards per attempt (34th in NFL). However, opposing quarterbacks have a 66.3 QBR (No. 25 in NFL) against the Chargers and are allowing 8.2 passing yards per attempt (No. 28). -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: The Bears' defense will force a minimum of three turnovers. Chicago led the league last year in takeaways and interceptions but is tied for 13th with just 10 takeaways in 2019. However, Los Angeles' offense is tied for 22nd with 12 giveaways. -- Eric D. Williams Stat to know: Melvin Gordon is averaging just 2.3 yards per rush this season, second worst in the NFL among those with at least 30 attempts. And the Chargers are averaging only 2.1 yards per rush since Gordon's return (last in NFL). What to know for fantasy: Allen Robinson II is on pace for 110 catches and eight touchdowns despite playing in a Bears offense that ranks 29th in passing yards per game. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Philip Rivers is 30-14-1 ATS in his career as a road underdog of at least three points, including 6-3-2 ATS since the Chargers franchise moved to Los Angeles. Read more.",38.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Drew Brees appears to have a good chance of returning just five weeks after thumb surgery, but the Saints could decide to play it safe and let backup Teddy Bridgewater try to extend his record to a perfect 6-0 with one last clip for his free-agent audition tape. Either way, the Saints should be licking their chops against a defense that ranks in the NFL's bottom five in both yards and points allowed. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson will hold Saints receiver Michael Thomas to fewer than 50 receiving yards while shadowing him the entire game. Peterson didn't shadow any receivers Sunday in his return from a six-week suspension, but that will change with Thomas on deck. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: Kyler Murray has four total touchdowns and zero interceptions in his past three games -- all wins -- after being responsible for five total touchdowns but also four interceptions in his first four games. The Cardinals have gotten more success from Murray by finding more balance; he dropped back to pass 53.7% of the time in the past three games as opposed 73.3% in the first four. What to know for fantasy: Saints tight end Jared Cook has scored in his past two games, and Josh Hill scored last week as a fill-in option. The Cardinals have allowed 161 tight end fantasy points this season, 52 more than any other defense. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Arizona is 5-1 ATS as an underdog this season (3-2-1 straight up), including three straight outright wins. Read more.",54.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Look for the Colts get back to their running game, because the Broncos have the third-stingiest pass defense in the NFL, giving up only 195.3 yards per game through the air. The Colts were limited to just 62 yards on the ground against Houston in Week 7 after rushing for at least 167 yards in three of their first five games. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Wide receiver Courtland Sutton will have the second 100-yard receiving game of his career. In six games this season, the Colts have surrendered five such games, including two in last week's win over the Texans. Sutton is now the unquestioned No. 1 after the trade of Emmanuel Sanders. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: The Colts are the third team since the 1970 merger with a winning record through six games and with all games having been decided by seven points or fewer (1995 Colts, 1983 Colts). No team in that time has started 5-2 or better with all seven games decided by seven points or fewer. What to know for fantasy: Sutton is one of three players with at least 75 receiving yards in each of his past three games, and the Broncos traded away Sanders earlier this week. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Thirteen of the past 15 Denver games went under the total, including each of the past three. Overall, Denver games are 17-5-1 to the under in the past two seasons, the best under percentage in the NFL. Read more.",40.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Atlanta coach Dan Quinn knows Russell Wilson well from his days as the Seahawks' defensive coordinator, but that doesn't mean he will find a way to pressure him. The Falcons haven't recorded a sack since Week 3 against the Colts and have a league-low five sacks. Wilson could have a field day. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Wilson will throw four touchdown passes. His 29-7 record following an in-season loss is the best by a quarterback since the 1970 merger. Now he faces a defense that ranks next-to-last in pressuring opposing QBs. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: The Falcons have allowed 223 points this season, their second most allowed through seven games in franchise history (they allowed 250 through the first seven games of the franchise's inaugural season in 1966). What to know for fantasy: Seattle receiver Tyler Lockett is on pace for a career-high 91 catches this season, but he has yet to score a touchdown on an even-numbered week. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta has failed to cover in five straight games and is now 6-17 ATS over the last two seasons, the worst record in the NFL. It is 2-7 ATS as an underdog in that span (1-4 this season). Read more.",54.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Philadelphia allows the sixth-most passing yards per game in the NFL, but Buffalo's passing game ranks 21st. It's yet to be seen which team is more capable of exploiting the other's weakness, but the Eagles can't afford to get into a multiple-score deficit against an elite Bills defense. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Carson Wentz will throw three touchdown passes against that tough Buffalo defense, and Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills, in his second game back from a foot injury, will create a turnover. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: The Eagles have allowed 75 points over the past two weeks. Dating to 1967, they have allowed 35 points in three straight games only once in franchise history. What to know for fantasy: Buffalo's Josh Allen was undrafted in 79.3% of leagues, while Wentz was an eighth-round pick this summer. But over their past three games, Allen has outscored Wentz by 8.1 fantasy points. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Eagles coach Doug Pederson is 12-7 straight up and ATS as an underdog of four or fewer points. Read more.",37.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bengals have one of the worst offenses in the NFL, averaging 305 yards and 16 points per game. That's unlikely to bode well against a Rams defense that's trending in a positive direction behind Aaron Donald and recently acquired cornerback Jalen Ramsey. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Donald will have two sacks. The Bengals' offensive line has done a better job of protecting quarterback Andy Dalton in recent weeks, but Donald should be able to take advantage of a very favorable matchup. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Cincinnati running back Joe Mixon is tied with Devonta Freeman for the most rushes in the NFL without a touchdown this season (84). What to know for fantasy: Todd Gurley II is RB10 on a per-game basis over the past four weeks, despite zero of his 63 touches gaining more than 13 yards. There have been 10 running backs to record a 14-plus yard touch this season. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Favorites are 22-12-1 ATS all time in international games (16-10 ATS in London games). And favorites of at least seven points are 6-1 ATS in international games. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Ty Johnson should be the focal point of Detroit's running game after Kerryon Johnson's injury, and the rookie can both run through the middle or show speed to get to the outside. After seeing what Chase Edmonds did to the Giants a week ago, Johnson could have a big day in his first major role with Detroit. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Saquon Barkley runs for 150 yards. The Giants' star running back should be healthier in his second game back from a high ankle sprain, and he's going against the league's 28th-ranked run defense, which allows almost 140 yards per game. But it's still not going to be enough for the Giants to get the victory. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: Giants QB Daniel Jones is 0-3 with 566 passing yards, three touchdowns and five interceptions over his past three starts. It's a far cry from the 2-0 start to his NFL career, in which he threw for 561 yards, three touchdowns and only two interceptions. What to know for fantasy: Ty Johnson averaged 7.6 yards per touch during his four seasons (348 carries) at Maryland and now steps into a feature role after Kerryon Johnson was placed on injured reserve. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Matt Patricia is 5-0 ATS against teams that entered the game with a losing record. And since 2014, Detroit is 22-11-2 ATS against teams with losing records. Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Jaguars are hurting at linebacker, with three players likely to miss the game (Leon Jacobs, Quincy Williams, Najee Goode), so that could mean a big day for Jets running back Le'Veon Bell. The last time he faced the Jaguars came in the playoffs after the 2017 season, and he ran for 67 yards and a TD and caught nine passes for 88 yards and another TD. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: Jets quarterback Sam Darnold won't be ""seeing ghosts,"" but he will see a lot of Jaguars defensive end Calais Campbell, who will equal his season total in sacks with three on the day. The Jets' offensive line, an absolute mess, will have major problems with the hulking Campbell, who lines up everywhere on the line. Campbell is ""playing as good as I've seen him play,"" Jets coach Adam Gase said. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: The Jets have allowed 26 sacks, second worst in the NFL this season, while the Jaguars' defense has 21 sacks (fourth). Darnold has been pressured on 35% of dropbacks this season (third-highest rate among qualified QBs), and his nine career interceptions under duress are tied for the most in the NFL over the last two seasons. What to know for fantasy: Jacksonville's Leonard Fournette leads the league with 115 touches over the past four weeks (645 scrimmage yards in the process). See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Gase is 4-13 ATS in his career as a road underdog of at least five points (1-16 straight up). Read more.",37.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Over the past 15 years, only three quarterbacks have won five or more consecutive starts to begin their career. Two of them -- Jimmy Garoppolo and Kyle Allen -- will meet here, and both are facing stiff tests in two of the league's four best pass defenses in net yards per attempt allowed. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: Christian McCaffrey will score two touchdowns. The San Francisco defense is allowing an average of 163.6 total yards over the past three games. But the Panthers running back is averaging 153.8 yards from scrimmage per game this season. Strength vs. strength, and in this one, McCaffrey will reach his average game TD total. -- David Newton Stat to know: McCaffrey has accounted for nearly 43.6% of his team's scrimmage yards this season, which is the highest mark by any player in the NFL. He has also accounted for the highest percentage of his team's touches (56%) and scrimmage touchdowns (53%). What to know for fantasy: Emmanuel Sanders joins a 49ers team that does not have a top-70 fantasy receiver this season. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Allen is 5-0 ATS and straight up as a starter, including 3-0 as an underdog. Only eight quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era have covered each of their first six career starts, with Patrick Mahomes and Brian Hoyer being the only two to do it in the last 10 seasons. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" What to watch for: It'll be an interception party. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield leads the NFL with 11 interceptions, the most by a Browns player through six games of a season since Paul McDonald in 1984 (12). Meanwhile, the Patriots' defense has totaled 18 interceptions. In the past 30 years, only the 1996 Packers had more picks through the first seven games of a season (20). -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: Nobody has scored more than 14 points against the Patriots, but Cleveland will become the first behind an inspired effort. Of course, it still won't be enough to win with Tom Brady on the other side. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: Odell Beckham Jr. recorded 101 receiving yards in his last game after having just 103 yards in his previous three combined. The Patriots have allowed just one 100-yard receiver this season (Golden Tate). What to know for fantasy: Pats running back James White leads the league with 11 red zone targets this season, and the Browns are allowing 2.2 red zone touchdowns per game this season (tied for fourth most). See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: New England is 28-0 at home (18-10 ATS) against quarterbacks under the age of 25 since 2001 (the start of the Brady era). Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Will either team have success running the ball? Both teams have done so well this season, but the Texans are ranked fourth in the NFL in run defense (allowing an average of 84.3 rushing yards per game), and the Raiders are ranked fifth (allowing 86.7 rushing yards per game). -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: Oakland's Clelin Ferrell will sack former Clemson teammate Deshaun Watson. Ferrell, the No. 4 overall draft pick, has only one sack, but he knows Watson's mannerisms and tendencies and can potentially project where Watson will go when flushed out of the pocket. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Darren Waller is second among tight ends with 44 catches this season, the most by a Raider through the team's first six games of a season in franchise history. He needs just three more Sunday for the most through seven games (Tim Brown, 46, 1999). What to know for fantasy: Kenny Stills steps in for an injured Will Fuller V this week, and he has seen 55.5% of his career fantasy points scored via the deep pass. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Oakland is one of two teams to be an underdog in every game this season (Miami). It won three games outright and failed to cover in any of its three losses. Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Kansas City coach Andy Reid has a history of getting good play from backup quarterbacks temporarily elevated into the starting lineup. But that ability gets tested in this game, with Matt Moore replacing the injured Patrick Mahomes. The Chiefs figure to need a significant number of points to beat Aaron Rodgers and the Packers, who are 10th in scoring at more than 26 points per game. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Rodgers won't score at will again as he did last week. That's bold only because of how well he's starting to play in new coach Matt LaFleur's system. The last time the Packers played a regular-season game at noisy Arrowhead Stadium, they saw their near-perfect 2011 season (15-1) suffer its only blemish. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: The Chiefs' LeSean McCoy is averaging 5.4 yards per rush, third among all running backs with a minimum of 60 carries (trails Matt Breida and Dalvin Cook). McCoy ranks 23rd all time in rushing and is just 40 yards shy of passing Warrick Dunn for 22nd. What to know for fantasy: Rodgers had as many total touchdowns as incompletions last week against Oakland (six), but no quarterback has thrown multiple touchdown passes in Arrowhead this season. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Reid is 15-8 ATS in his career in the regular season with at least 10 days between games. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: With Mason Rudolph back from concussion protocol, the Steelers should take significant steps toward finding a balanced offense against the woeful Dolphins. The Dolphins' pass defense ranks toward the bottom of the league, allowing 256.5 passing yards per game, while the rush defense is even worse at second-to-last with 160.8 yards per game. Look for another monster game from James Conner and perhaps a rebound performance for receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: The Steelers' Minkah Fitzpatrick gets an interception against his former team. The Dolphins traded Fitzpatrick to Pittsburgh in September, and he has a strong knowledge of how Miami's offense operates under quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who is known to be a gunslinger. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: The Dolphins have been outscored by 93 points in the second half of games this season. That's the third-worst second-half scoring margin in NFL history through seven games, according to research by the Elias Sports Bureau (1950 Baltimore Colts, minus-106, and 1925 Milwaukee Badgers, minus-102). What to know for fantasy: Conner has a rushing touchdown or has caught at least four passes in every game this season. That's not a bad trend to take into a game against a Dolphins team that is allowing 31.2 running back points per game (second most). See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past 25 seasons, teams with 0-3 or worse records are 12-4 ATS in Monday games (8-8 outright). Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Dalvin Cook leads the NFL in rushing, and the Chiefs have allowed more yards on the ground than all but two other teams, both of which are winless. So, Kansas City faces a big challenge, and likely without any of its regular starting defensive linemen. Quarterback Matt Moore was impressive in his Chiefs starting debut last week, but the Vikings, who are fifth in the league in total defense, are an upgrade in competition. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Minnesota will tie its previous best effort against the run recorded on Dec. 31, 2017, when it held the Bears to 30 rushing yards. Andy Reid has been able to hide the weakness of his running game for some time now, but that ends this week against a stout Vikings defense. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: The Chiefs rank among the NFL leaders in points per game (fourth at 28.3), yards per game (fifth at 392.5) and passing yards per game (second at 309.5). What to know for fantasy: Since 2016, Stefon Diggs' average fantasy points per game drops by nearly 25% when playing outside the NFC North. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota is 2-8-1 both ATS and straight up in Kirk Cousins' starts against teams that entered with winning records, including 0-6-1 on the road (both ATS and SU). Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Rookie Andre Dillard will make his this third NFL start at left tackle. Star edge rusher Khalil Mack moves all over the formation and is likely to spend a good amount of time on Dillard's side. Whether the Eagles' offense can function at a high level will depend largely on whether Dillard can rise to the occasion. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Jordan Howard rushes for 100-plus yards against his old team. Chicago ranks sixth in net rushing yards allowed per game (86.0). However, the Bears' run defense is nowhere near as good without defensive tackle Akiem Hicks (injured reserve/elbow), whose absence is felt every week. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Carson Wentz has 11 straight games of throwing at least one passing touchdown (tied for the longest active streak in NFL with Russell Wilson). What to know for fantasy: David Montgomery scored 2.5 more fantasy points last week than he did in his three games prior. But now he takes on the sixth-best defense against fantasy running backs this season. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Philadelphia is 2-8 ATS as a home favorite over the past two seasons, including 0-5 ATS when favored by five or fewer points. Read more.",37.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Colts rank toward the bottom of the league in rushing defense. Even if Benny Snell Jr. and James Conner don't play, Pittsburgh's run game led by Jaylen Samuels and aided by fullback Roosevelt Nix should be strong enough to keep the game close. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: The Colts will record multiple sacks even though the Steelers have given up an NFL-low seven sacks this season, with two of those against Miami in Week 8. The Colts have a total of 10 sacks during their three-game winning streak, and defensive end Justin Houston has four in that time. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: Mason Rudolph has a 6.6 QBR in the red zone this season, second worst in the NFL. In all, the Steelers have scored a touchdown on just 41.2% of their red zone drives, fifth worst in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Marlon Mack has at least 20 touches in three straight games. But tread lightly, as the Steelers have yet to allow a single running back amass even 90 yards or 14 fantasy points. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Indianapolis has covered six straight games when the line has been has been from -3 to +3, and it has won seven straight games outright (6-0-1 ATS). It is 3-0 ATS and SU in that spot this season. Read more.",37.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Will we see composure and poise from Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen after he lost some of the calmness that was a strength while throwing three picks last week against the 49ers? The Titans have a physical, aggressive defense that will try to do to Allen what the 49ers did. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Derrick Henry will finish with more rushing yards than Christian McCaffrey. The Panthers' run defense is allowing 135.1 yards per game, and Henry is coming off a career-high 4.7 yards per attempt against a Bucs defense that was tops in the league in allowing only 2.8 yards per attempt. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Titans are tied for third in red zone efficiency this season (66.7%), which would be their second-best number in the past 15 seasons. What to know for fantasy: From Week 8 of last season through Week 8 of this season, McCaffrey has as many games with both a rushing touchdown and a receiving touchdown (five) as any other two running backs combined. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: As an underdog of at least three points, Tennessee is 8-2 ATS and 7-3 outright under Mike Vrabel. Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Since Bill Callahan took over as interim coach in Week 6, Washington quietly ranks 10th in the league in rushing yards and eighth in yards per attempt. After the Eagles steamrolled the Bills on the ground last week (218 yards, three touchdowns), Washington likely will look to implement a similar game plan. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Frank Gore will outrush Adrian Peterson in a battle of future Hall of Fame running backs. Gore will rush for 75 yards and a touchdown; Peterson will have a solid first half, but Washington's inability to convert on third-down passes and extend drives will hold him to 65 yards. -- John Keim Stat to know: The Redskins have gone nine straight quarters without scoring a touchdown, the longest active streak in the NFL and second longest in the 2019 season (Miami, 10). What to know for fantasy: The Bills' D/ST has reached double figures four times this season (tied for the third most), while the Redskins have allowed opposing D/STs to score double-digit fantasy points five times (tied for the second most). See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Washington played last Thursday. Since 2014, teams coming off a Thursday game and that are road underdogs of at least seven points are 15-5-1 ATS. Since 2001, those teams are 33-17-1 ATS. Read more.",28.0,LOW
" What to watch for: This is a matchup between the NFL's two worst offenses in terms of yardage and points per game. Expect points to be at a premium. It could come down to the quarterbacks: Sam Darnold vs. Ryan Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick has a 51.5 QBR as compared to Darnold's 33.6 thus far this season. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: Le'Veon Bell's long-awaited breakout game will happen against the NFL's 31st-ranked run defense. We're not talking monster numbers here (remember, the Jets' offensive line is terrible), but he will exceed his season high (70 yards). -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: Per Elias Sports Bureau research, this is the first game in NFL history in which both teams enter with a minus-100 point differential or worse and are both fewer than eight games into the season. What to know for fantasy: Exclude the game against the ghostly Patriots, and Darnold's 16-game pace this season would be a 69.9% completion percentage, 3,899 passing yards and 27 touchdown passes. It's not great, but it's better than you think and worth a look against the fourth-most-friendly defense to fantasy quarterbacks. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: In the Super Bowl era, teams with records of 1-5 or worse are 4-18 ATS and 7-15 SU as road favorites. Since 2015, teams that are 1-4 or worse and are listed as road favorites are 0-8 ATS. Read more.",26.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Will Russell Wilson have to carry the Seahawks' offense? They'll want to run the ball, like always, but might have trouble doing so against a Bucs defense that has allowed a league-low 68.6 rushing yards per game. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: A bold prediction would be calling an upset, despite Bruce Arians' 4-1 record in Seattle against Pete Carroll. But this Bucs team lacks what his Cardinals squads had: the ability to pile on points early and close out games on defense. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Jameis Winston has 15 turnovers through seven games this season, already his most through eight games in any season of his career. The last players with more turnovers through their teams' first eight games were Eli Manning (17) and Geno Smith (16) in 2013. What to know for fantasy: Last week, Mike Evans joined Charlie Hennigan (1961) as the only receivers to post multiple 40-point fantasy games in their teams' first seven games of a given season. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Seattle is 0-5 ATS in its past five home games (0-4 this season). Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: With the Lions having the 26th-ranked run defense in the league, and the Raiders countering with the 30th-ranked pass defense, expect a lot of offense in this contest. The Raiders should ride Josh Jacobs early and often, while Matthew Stafford has to be excited at the thought of carving up Oakland's secondary. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: Stafford will post his third consecutive 300-yard game, going three straight for the first time since the final three regular-season games of the 2011 season. He also will throw at least three touchdowns for the third straight week. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Detroit's Kenny Golladay has three games with 100 receiving yards this season (including last week), equaling his total for all of last season. And the Raiders have allowed five 100-yard pass-catchers this season (tied for the fifth most in the NFL). What to know for fantasy: Tyrell Williams has scored five times on his 20 receptions this season (25% of his receptions). All other Raiders have scored on 5% of their receptions. See Week 9 rankings.

" What to watch for: If the Chargers can figure out how to stop Aaron Jones, hold up in coverage and make Aaron Rodgers uncomfortable by sending just four pass-rushers up front, they could make things interesting. That's a lot on the to-do list, though. -- Eric D. Williams Bold prediction: This is going to feel like a home game for the Packers. If you thought they had a lot of fans in L.A. last year at the Coliseum against the Rams, wait until you see all the Cheeseheads this Sunday. Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said: ""We don't play the fans; we play the Packers."" -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: The Chargers are the first team in the Super Bowl era (since 1966) with four straight games of under 40 rushing yards. What to know for fantasy: Over the past two weeks, Packers running backs have more fantasy points as pass-catchers (77.5) than Patriots (75.9) or Vikings (69.9) wide receivers. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Los Angeles is 8-1-2 ATS in the Lynn era as a regular-season underdog of less than seven points. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Quarterback Brandon Allen will take his first regular-season snap on Sunday, 42 months after being selected in the sixth round of the 2016 draft by the Jaguars, and he'll do it against Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, who is tied for the league lead in sacks with 10. Allen faces an uphill battle playing behind a line that surrendered 26 sacks with Joe Flacco under center. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Odell Beckham Jr. will double his touchdown total on the season, with two scoring grabs at Mile High. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: The Browns have played the second-toughest schedule so far this season, according to FPI, but they have the second-easiest remaining slate. What to know for fantasy: Nick Chubb quietly has a run of at least 37 yards in four straight games. A fifth straight would tie him with Steven Jackson for the second most since 2001.

" What to watch for: Lamar Jackson has produced an NFL-best 262 scramble yards this season -- 88 more than anyone else -- by sidestepping and sprinting past tacklers. Meanwhile, the Patriots have allowed the second-most yards per rush on scrambles in the past 10 years. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Ben Watson will catch a touchdown pass from Tom Brady. The Patriots have struggled to run consistently, so the odds are greater that the offense will once again need to rely more on the passing game. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: Mark Ingram II has seven rushing touchdowns this season, the fourth most in the NFL. And over the past five seasons, his 37 rushing scores trail only Todd Gurley II (52). What to know for fantasy: The Patriots' D/ST has scored at least 23 points four times this season. The other 31 D/STs in the league? Four such games. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past 10 seasons, New England is 31-13-2 ATS in prime-time games. But over the past six seasons, Baltimore is 11-4 ATS in prime time. Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Dak Prescott and the Cowboys bring the NFL's No. 1 offense (437.9 yards per game) to Monday Night Football. That could spell trouble for a Giants defense that ranks 25th against the pass. Prescott has thrown 13 touchdowns passes and no interceptions in his past five games against the Giants. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: The Cowboys will hold Saquon Barkley to fewer than 100 rushing yards. Barkley has two 100-yard outings in three games against the Cowboys, but he has needed runs of 68 and 59 yards to reach 109 and 120 yards in those. The Cowboys' run defense has been only OK, but it is as healthy and as confident as it has been all season. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: The Cowboys have done most of their damage this season using 11 personnel (1 RB, 1 TE and 3 WRs). They are averaging an NFL-high 7.5 yards per play out of that package, with 18 offensive touchdowns. Only the Chiefs have scored more touchdowns using 11 personnel this season (20). What to know for fantasy: The Cowboys have won five straight over the Giants, and Prescott is a big reason why, averaging 310 passing yards and 25.1 fantasy points per game. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past three seasons, Dallas is 13-2 outright and ATS in division games, including covering seven straight. It has covered all five meetings against New York in that span.

" What to watch for: How do the Texans cope without defensive end J.J. Watt? Jaguars quarterback Gardner Minshew II was sacked four times when the teams played in Houston in September. Jacksonville has allowed 18 sacks this season, which ranks 17th in the NFL. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: The Jaguars will hold running back Carlos Hyde to less than 40 yards rushing. After giving up 176 yards and two touchdowns rushing to Christian McCaffrey in Week 5, the Jaguars have shut down Alvin Kamara (31 yards), Joe Mixon (2 yards) and Le'Veon Bell (23 yards). -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Houston's DeAndre Hopkins has at least five receptions in 11 straight games dating back to last season, the second-longest active streak in the NFL (Michael Thomas, 13). What to know for fantasy: Leonard Fournette leads the NFL in touches (198) and owns the longest active streak of games with at least 75 total yards (eight in a row). See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Favorites are 16-10 against the spread (ATS) all time in London games (2-1 this season). Read more.",36.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Chiefs' run defense is subpar (139 yards against per game), which is perfect for the run-oriented offensive identity the Titans say they want to have. Derrick Henry got only 13 carries last weekend in a loss to Carolina, another team that has struggled to stop the run this season. It will be imperative for Tennessee to get Henry touches to keep the ball away from the Kansas City offense as much as possible. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: The Chiefs will hold the Titans to fewer than 100 rushing yards and less than 4.0 yards per carry for the third time in four games. Kansas City is improving defensively to the point that Tennessee's Henry won't be much of a factor. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Since making a quarterback switch from Marcus Mariota to Ryan Tannehill, the Titans' offense has averaged 5.7 yards per play compared to 4.8 yards per play before the change under center. What to know for fantasy: When a running back gets at least 14 carries against the Chiefs this season, he averages 109.4 rushing yards. Henry is averaging 18.2 carries per game this season. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Patrick Mahomes is 9-3-1 against the spread (ATS) on the road in his career, and the over is 10-3 in those games. Read more.",49.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Saints are rolling with six consecutive wins, while Atlanta is off the rails with six consecutive losses. It's hard to imagine the Falcons throwing Drew Brees off his game, since they rank last in the NFL with seven sacks, four takeaways and an opponents' Total QBR of 66.6. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: Deion Jones, a New Orleans native, will pick off Brees for the fourth time in five games and for the third time in his hometown. -- Vaughn McClure Stat to know: Brees is 2-0 with an 86.3 QBR in his past two games against the Falcons, throwing seven touchdowns and just one interception. The Saints averaged 37 points in those games. What to know for fantasy: The Saints are allowing the sixth-most yards per tight end target this season, and Austin Hooper ranks second among qualified TEs in yards per target this season. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: New Orleans has covered in six straight games, the longest active streak in the NFL. Meanwhile, Atlanta is 7-17 ATS over the past two seasons, the worst mark in the NFL (2-6 ATS this season, tied for worst in the NFL). Read more.",56.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will each of the offenses execute? The Bears average 266.8 yards per game (29th in the NFL) and 4.5 per play (30th), but Chicago's defense gives up an average of only 18 points (sixth). Detroit is the exact opposite. The Lions' offense is fifth in yards per game and seventh in yards per play, but they have the league's 31st-ranked defense. Something has to give on Sunday. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: In the first game the Lions have played without Matthew Stafford since 2010, Bears pass rusher Khalil Mack feasts, sacking Jeff Driskel three times with a Detroit offense that barely musters 200 yards of offense.. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Chicago running back David Montgomery has 223 scrimmage yards and three scrimmage touchdowns on 48 touches over the past two games. He began the season with just 316 scrimmage yards and two scrimmage touchdowns on 82 touches in his first six games. What to know for fantasy: Stafford, who won't play Sunday, ranks third in fantasy points per pass attempt this season (behind only Patrick Mahomes and Russell Wilson), but his point total has declined in three consecutive games against the Bears. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Detroit has failed to cover three straight games, and Chicago has failed to cover four straight. In the past 20 years, the team with the better season ATS record is 23-4 ATS in matchups in which both teams enter the game with at least three-game losing streaks ATS. So far this season, Detroit is 4-4 ATS and Chicago is 2-6. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bucs' defense surrendered 399 total yards last weekend to Russell Wilson, including 378 passing. This weekend, it faces Kyler Murray, whom Bucs coach Bruce Arians called ""a real fast Russell Wilson."" But the Cardinals haven't fared much better on defense, either, and they'll face the league's only pair of 700-plus-yard receivers in Mike Evans (842 yards) and Chris Godwin (766 yards). -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: Kenyan Drake and David Johnson will each run for at least 75 yards and a touchdown as the Cardinals figure out that they have one of the best two-headed running back situations in the NFL. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: Per Elias Sports Bureau research, Murray has thrown 172 consecutive passes without an interception, the third-longest streak by a rookie in NFL history (176 by Derek Carr in 2014 and 176 by Dak Prescott in 2016). What to know for fantasy: This one features two of the four worst defenses in terms of limiting fantasy QB production and two quarterbacks who have not one but two games of 25-plus points this season. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Jameis Winston is 4-11 ATS and 7-8 straight up as a favorite in his career. And he is 1-7 ATS and 3-5 straight up as a favorite of at least three points.

" What to watch for: Bengals rookie quarterback Ryan Finley will make his NFL debut. But all eyes will be on the Baltimore offense. The division-leading Ravens have the best rushing attack in the league, and Cincinnati has the worst rushing defense. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: The Ravens will run for 360 yards, the highest total for any team this decade. How's that for bold? Baltimore leads the NFL in rushing and gained 269 yards on the ground against Cincinnati earlier this season. The Bengals have allowed 1,421 yards rushing, over 200 more than any other team in the league. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: Speaking of the Ravens' run game, their 1,639 rushing yards are the most by any team through eight games since the 2006 Falcons (1,641). The most through nine games since the 1970 merger is 1,958 by the 1975 Bills. What to know for fantasy: Ravens receiver Marquise Brown ranks 16th in yards per catch this season (minimum 20 receptions), and the Bengals are allowing a league-high 16.9 yards per deep pass attempt. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Baltimore is 33-0 all time as a double-digit favorite, the only active franchise to never lose such a game. However, over the past 10 seasons, Baltimore is just 3-10 ATS in those games (0-2 this season). Read more.",37.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bills own the NFL's top red zone offense, while the Browns have one of the worst. Star wideout Odell Beckham Jr. has only three red zone targets the entire season. After going 1-of-5 in the red zone last weekend, will Cleveland finally be able to get OBJ involved near the end zone? -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: Bills wide receiver John Brown will finish with a game high in receiving yards. Brown is quietly on pace for a career-high 1,200 receiving yards and is Josh Allen's unquestioned top target. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: Buffalo running back Devin Singletary had a career-high 140 scrimmage yards vs. the Redskins in Week 9, the most by a Bills player in the past two seasons and the most by a Bills rookie running back since Marshawn Lynch in 2007. He is seeking to become first Bill with 140-plus yards from scrimmage in consecutive games since LeSean McCoy had two separate two-game streaks in 2016. What to know for fantasy: Cleveland's Nick Chubb has been responsible for 82.4% of Cleveland's rush attempts this season, putting him on pace for the highest rate since Rudi Johnson in 2004 (82.6%). See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: This is the seventh time in the past 25 seasons that a team with a .250 or lower winning percentage is favored over a team with a .750 or better winning percentage in Week 6 or later. The favorite is 6-0 ATS in the previous six games. And it's just the third time in the Super Bowl era it's happened in Week 10 or later (2-0 ATS previously). Read more.",36.0,LOW
" What to watch for: It's a battle of 22-year-old quarterbacks in Sam Darnold vs. Daniel Jones -- only the 13th matchup in the Super Bowl era between quarterbacks 22 or younger. They've combined for 17 interceptions, so this could get sloppy. The Giants, heavily criticized for passing on Darnold in the 2018 draft, can claim validation if the rookie Jones outplays Darnold and leads them to victory. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: New Giants defensive tackle Leonard Williams gets two sacks against his former team. That's significant because he has two sacks in his past 20 games. Then again, he has never been able to face this bad Jets offensive line in anything other than a practice. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: Entering his 23rd NFL game, Giants running back Saquon Barkley stands 51 receiving yards shy of 1,000 for his career. Per Elias Sports Bureau research, the fewest games needed to reach 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards in NFL history are Alvin Kamara (20), Herschel Walker (22) and Charley Taylor (23). What to know for fantasy: Jets wide receiver Jamison Crowder owns a 26.9% target share from Darnold this season, and the Giants are allowing the third-most wide receiver PPG (41.6). See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: In the past five seasons, there have been 15 matchups in Week 6 or later between two teams with winning percentages of .250 or lower. In all 15 games, the underdog covered, going 14-1 straight up. Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: It'll be all about the Colts' offensive line vs. the Dolphins' defense. The Indianapolis O-line should be able to regain any confidence lost of late because Miami has only 12 sacks, 30th in the NFL. The Colts gave up an NFL-low 18 sacks in 2018 but have given up nine in the past two games (Denver and Pittsburgh). -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Indianapolis' Marlon Mack rushes for 150 yards. The Dolphins are allowing 150.8 rushing yards per game, and although they've improved a bit defensively, they are still susceptible to getting thrashed in run game. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: The Dolphins snapped a 10-game losing streak last weekend against the Jets, but they have not won back-to-back games since December 2018 (vs. the Bills and Patriots, respectively, in Weeks 13 and 14). What to know for fantasy: Miami's DeVante Parker ranks 11th among receivers with at least 25 catches this season in terms of points per reception, and he should see a spike in target share with Preston Williams out for the season. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami has covered four consecutive games after starting the season 0-4 ATS. It's the second-longest active cover streak in the NFL behind only New Orleans (six straight). Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Steelers' offensive linemen have done a solid job protecting Mason Rudolph, giving up a league-low eight sacks this season. But Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald is a wrecking machine who will challenge that low number. His sacks were down earlier in the season, but over the past three weeks, the reigning Defensive Player of the Year has racked up four sacks and two forced fumbles. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Rams running back Todd Gurley has yet rush for 100 yards in a single game this season, but coming off a bye week and with the Rams needing a spark to climb back into the playoff picture, look for Jared Goff to hand off to him early and often. The Steelers' run defense has allowed an average of 107.5 yards per game, 16th in the league. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Pittsburgh receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is the first player in NFL history to record 200 career catches (202) before his 23rd birthday (won't turn 23 until Nov. 22). What to know for fantasy: Gurley is averaging just 2.9 yards per carry in the Rams' past three true road games, and the Steelers are allowing the seventh-fewest running back PPG this season. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Sean McVay is 10-0 straight up and 7-2-1 ATS against AFC teams in regular-season games. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How in the world will the Packers stop Christian McCaffrey? The Packers have allowed 39 gains of 20 yards or more this season (including 13 of 40-plus), and McCaffrey is an explosive gain waiting to happen. Green Bay defensive coordinator Mike Pettine will have to devise something different for the NFL's leader in yards from scrimmage and touchdowns. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: The Panthers, who lead the NFL in sacks with 34, will sack Aaron Rodgers at least four times and rattle him enough to make this one closer than most expect. Carolina edge rusher Bruce Irvin said, ""You rush and get on their ass early, they'll be thinking about you the rest of the game.'' -- David Newton Stat to know: The Packers' offensive line has been strong in the pass-protection game. The unit has posted a 65.9% pass block win rate this season, the third-highest in the league. The team's two losses this season have been in games where it has posted two of its three worst pass block win rates. What to know for fantasy: The Panthers are allowing the sixth-most running back points per game this season, and Aaron Jones ranks behind only McCaffrey among qualified running backs in points per touch. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen is 6-1 ATS and straight up as a starter (3-1 as an underdog). In the past 10 seasons, the only quarterbacks to start their careers 7-1 or better ATS are Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott, Brian Hoyer and Andy Dalton. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Kirk Cousins' history against the Cowboys is not good. He is 1-6 against his former NFC East rival, and although he has thrown at least one touchdown pass in his seven starts against them, he has been intercepted in five. The Cowboys have picked off a pass in three straight games, their longest streak since intercepting at least one pass in four consecutive games in Weeks 10-13 last season. They want to slow down the league's leading rusher, Dalvin Cook, and put this game on Cousins' arm. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Cowboys QB Dak Prescott throws for three touchdowns. The Vikings' defense has allowed 66 points in Minnesota's past two road games and ranks 10th in opponent yards per play (5.2). It's the big plays and yards after the catch to be concerned with here, as Amari Cooper, Blake Jarwin and Michael Gallup demonstrated against the Giants. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Cook's 1,232 yards from scrimmage is the second-most through nine games in Vikings history (Adrian Peterson had 1,301 in 2007). The most through 10 games is 1,347 by Chuck Foreman in 1976. What to know for fantasy: Cousins has completed over 80% of his passes or thrown three-plus touchdown passes in five straight games. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota is 0-7-1 both ATS and straight up in Cousins' starts on the road against teams that entered with winning records. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" What to watch for: These are two of the top five rushing teams in the league, and both have run defenses allowing 4.7 or more yards per carry. Getting the run game going will be important for both sides, but especially for the 49ers -- a strong ground game can be the most effective way to slow Russell Wilson by keeping him off the field. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: The Seahawks will hold the 49ers' second-ranked rushing offense to under 125 yards as they try to make Jimmy Garoppolo beat them instead. The matchup suits Seattle's defense in one respect: San Francisco has run the second-fewest offensive snaps with at least three receivers on the field, which will allow the Seahawks to run their preferred base defense without as many linebacker-on-receiver mismatches. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: The 49ers have 303 rushing attempts this season, the most by any team through eight games since the 2008 Ravens. And they are calling a designed run play 54% of the time, the highest rate by any team through eight games since the 2010 Chiefs (54%). What to know for fantasy: Seahawks receiver Tyler Lockett already has 14 red zone targets this season, the second-most in the NFL and nine more than he had all of last season. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Wilson is 12-3 ATS and straight up in his career against San Francisco. However, San Francisco is 2-3 ATS in his past five games. Read more.",56.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Expect a lot of scoring from Lamar Jackson and Deshaun Watson. This marks the second time in NFL history that two starting quarterbacks under the age of 25 with a passer rating of 100 or better will square off in Week 11 or later. The first occurred a year ago this week, when Jared Goff and the Rams defeated Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs 54-51. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: The Ravens break the Texans' steak of not allowing a 100-yard rusher in each of the past two seasons. Jackson and the Ravens have produced six individual 100-yard rushing games this season, tied with the Cowboys and Panthers for most in the NFL. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: The Texans got four sacks against Jacksonville in their first game without defensive end J.J. Watt this season, but they struggled to win consistently in the trenches. According to ESPN's pass rush win rate using NFL Next Gen Stats, the Texans beat their blocks within 2.5 seconds just 28% of the time in Week 9 without Watt, compared to 44% in their first eight games. What to know for fantasy: These two quarterbacks share the position lead in games of 25-plus fantasy points this season (five). See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Watson is 11-3 against the spread (ATS) in his career as an underdog. Read more.",69.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Bucs might potentially start two rookie cornerbacks -- Jamel Dean and Sean Murphy-Bunting -- on the outside against Drew Brees, who has lost consecutive division games in a single season just four times since joining the Saints, according to ESPN Stats & Information research (the last time was in 2016, losing to Carolina and then at Tampa Bay). -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: New Orleans running back Alvin Kamara will put a jolt back into his season with 150 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns. The Saints' offense obviously needs a spark, and Kamara is now far enough removed from his ankle and knee injuries that coach Sean Payton should be able to unleash him a little more. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Saints receiver Michael Thomas has at least 10 receptions and 100 yards in back-to-back games. Only four players in NFL history have done it three or more times in a row. In the Week 5 meeting between these two teams, Thomas had 11 catches for 182 yards and a pair of touchdowns. What to know for fantasy: Tampa Bay's Mike Evans led all players (not just receivers) in fantasy points scored via the deep pass last season and is on pace to do it again this season. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: New Orleans is 9-3 ATS on the road over the past two seasons, the best mark in the NFL. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Ezekiel Elliott had 152 yards rushing and 88 yards receiving when these teams played last season. The Lions' run defense might be worse than a season ago -- and Elliott might be better. If the Dallas running back is able to get going early, he could be in line for another monster day, considering Detroit's struggles against top-flight backs all year long. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: The Cowboys will score a touchdown on their first possession. They have scored only once on the first drive in a game this season and did so with a short field after a defensive takeaway against Philadelphia. Making this even bolder: The Lions have allowed just one touchdown on opponents' first possession. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: Dallas leads the NFL in third-down conversion rate (51.4%). And the Lions are allowing teams to convert on 44.8% of third downs, tied for 26th in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Through 10 weeks, only Lamar Jackson and Patrick Mahomes have a higher average weekly fantasy ranking than Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Entering this week, Dallas is one of two teams to be favored in every game this season (New England). Read more.",50.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Vikings running back Dalvin Cook has notched 100 yards of offense in eight of his 10 games this season. The role he has taken on in the passing game has allowed Minnesota to dismantle teams with its explosive screen and play-action attack. Even if the Broncos sell out to stop Cook on the ground, they'll have to account for him, Stefon Diggs, Kyle Rudolph and Irv Smith Jr. through the air. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: The Broncos will get a rushing touchdown. While Courtland Sutton figures to have a big day for the Broncos, the Vikings have surrendered just two rushing touchdowns all season, and both have come in two of their losses -- to the Packers and to the Chiefs. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Minnesota quarterback Kirk Cousins had the fourth-worst Total QBR (28.0) among qualified QBs and a 64.6% completion mark through four weeks. But since Week 5, he is completing 71.5% of his passes (third best in the NFL) and has 15 passing touchdowns to just one interception. And his 73.7 QBR ranks fourth in the NFL during that span. What to know for fantasy: Sutton has accounted for 34.3% of his team's receiving yards, the NFL's second-highest rate behind Michael Thomas. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota is 32-13-1 ATS at home under Mike Zimmer, the best mark by any coach in the Super Bowl era (minimum 25 games). Read more.",40.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Keep an eye on the battle between the Colts' offensive line and the Jaguars' defensive line. Quarterback Jacoby Brissett, expected to start after missing the Week 10 game with a sprained left MCL, was sacked 14 times, including 10 in one game, in two starts against the Jaguars in 2017. Brissett said their offensive line is different from two years ago; that's a good thing because the Jaguars are sixth in the NFL in sacks with 30. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Jaguars tailback Leonard Fournette will score two red zone touchdowns. The Jaguars have struggled scoring touchdowns in the red zone (34.5%, 30th in the NFL), but the return of Nick Foles under center will help. His experience will lead to quicker decisions and should open things up for Fournette, who has just one rushing touchdown this season. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Foles is 10-2 as a starter in November or later (including playoffs) over the past four seasons. That's the best winning percentage (.833) by a starting QB with at least 12 starts in that time, besting Tom Brady's 27-7 record. What to know for fantasy: The Colts' Jack Doyle (46% available) is one of four tight ends with at least 10 fantasy points in each of his past three games. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past four seasons, Jacksonville is 7-0-1 ATS against Indianapolis. And Indianapolis has been shut out in two of the past four meetings. Read more.",35.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Watch for Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey and the Carolina offensive line to control this game and keep Julio Jones off the field. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Jones goes for 200 yards and three touchdowns. His career-high yardage was 300 against the Panthers in 2016. Matt Ryan will find Jones for a couple of big plays off hard play-action as the Falcons have done to the Panthers in the past. -- Vaughn McClure Stat to know: Ryan has a career-low 58.6 Total QBR through eight starts but still ranks 11th among 33 qualifying QBs. Perhaps not helping the matter, the Falcons have the fourth-worst pass block win rate using NFL Next Gen Stats (47%) in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: McCaffrey has more fantasy points as a pass-catcher this season than JuJu Smith-Schuster. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta has covered back-to-back games after starting 1-6 ATS. Over the past two seasons, Atlanta is 4-3 ATS in divisional games and 4-14 ATS in all other games. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Redskins will want to run vs. the Jets' run defense. In the Redskins' past four games, running back Adrian Peterson averaged 5.1 yards per carry and 18.8 carries per game. But in the Jets' past four games, their run defense has allowed just 2.4 yards per carry on 109 attempts. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Rookie Washington quarterback Dwayne Haskins will throw his first touchdown pass and rookie receiver Terry McLaurin will top the 100-yard mark for the second time in three games. Haskins is struggling, but he will face an inviting group of cornerbacks -- perhaps the weakest group of corners he'll see in his NFL career. Due to injuries, the Jets are down to backups and unheralded rookies. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: The Redskins have gone 13 straight quarters without scoring a touchdown, the longest streak in the NFL this season and tied for the third-longest single-season streak by any team since 2001. What to know for fantasy: Jets receiver Jamison Crowder has two top-11 finishes at the position this season, and they've both come in the past two weeks. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Since 2014, favorites that have won one or zero games in Week 8 or later are 1-9 ATS and 2-8 straight up with six straight outright losses. Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Frank Gore is 73 yards from passing Barry Sanders for third on the all-time rushing list. Dolphins coach Brian Flores -- who played against Gore in college -- has made it known that a top priority is stopping Gore, Devin Singletary, quarterback Josh Allen and the Bills' 12th-ranked run offense from going wild on their defense. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: This Bills' offense finally comes to life, as Allen completes his first pass that travels 30-plus yards and Singletary racks up more than 100 total yards. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: With a win, the Dolphins would become the fifth team in NFL history to win three straight games after starting the season 0-7 or worse (joining the 1978 St. Louis Cardinals, 1986 Indianapolis Colts, 2011 Miami Dolphins and 2013 Tampa Bay Buccaneers), per Elias Sports Bureau research. What to know for fantasy: Miami's DeVante Parker has a touchdown or more than 55 receiving yards in seven straight games. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami has covered five straight games, all as an underdog, including back-to-back outright wins. It's the longest active cover streak in the league. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The 49ers scorched Arizona with their passing game two weeks ago, but it's fair to wonder if they can do it again with tight end George Kittle and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders day-to-day with injuries. If Arizona can successfully slow the Niners' running game, and the 49ers struggle to throw it as well as they did in the previous meeting, the Cardinals could again push for the upset. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: San Francisco defensive end Nick Bosa will take advantage of the Cardinals' offensive line with three sacks of Kyler Murray, showing off for the team that passed on him with the first overall pick at the 2019 NFL draft. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: The Cardinals rank 10th in the NFL in ESPN's pass block win rate (60%) powered by NFL Next Gen Stats, and Murray has faced the blitz on only 29.2% of his dropbacks, the 12th-lowest rate in the NFL. But that hasn't stopped the rookie QB from taking 31 sacks, the third most in the league this season. What to know for fantasy: Niners quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has failed to finish better than QB20 in three of the past four weeks. The lone exception? A QB2 finish against these Cardinals in Week 9. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Since 2011, teams playing on Sunday coming off a Monday night loss (San Francisco) are 53-81-2 ATS, including 20-36 ATS since 2016. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Receiver Alshon Jeffery (ankle) has been unable to practice this week for the Eagles, putting his status in question. With DeSean Jackson already out for the rest of the regular season, Carson Wentz will have limited weapons at his disposal against a Patriots defense that ranks first in interceptions (19) and passing touchdowns allowed (3). -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: First-round draft choice N'Keal Harry will be active for the first time this season for the Patriots, and the wide receiver will be targeted in the red zone for a touchdown grab on a fade route, where his size and physicality can be tapped. The Eagles are tough to run against, so the passing attack figures to be a bigger part of the Patriots' offensive approach. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: When pressured this season, Tom Brady is completing just 28% of his passes (last in the NFL). And while under duress, his passes are off-target a league-high 51% of the time. The Patriots' offensive line ranks 23rd in the league in ESPN's pass block win rate powered by NFL Next Gen Stats, sustaining their blocks for 2.5 seconds 54.5% of the time. What to know for fantasy: Eagles tight end Zach Ertz is coming off of his best game of the season (nine catches for 103 yards and a touchdown in Week 9), and the Patriots have allowed opponents to complete an NFL-high 74.3% of their passes thrown to tight ends this season. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Brady is 40-18 ATS in his career following a loss. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Raiders will use their running game against the worst run defense in the league (the Bengals are giving up 173.0 yards per game) to set up play-action passing to tight end Darren Waller. If they handle their business against the winless Bengals and at the 2-7 Jets next week, the Raiders will roll into Kansas City on Dec. 1 with first place in the AFC West on the line. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: Waller will have two touchdowns. The Bengals have struggled to contain opposing tight ends, and Waller should be a matchup problem all afternoon. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Oakland running back Josh Jacobs' 811 rushing yards this season are already a team rookie record. And he has three games with at least 100 yards rushing, tied with Hall of Famer Marcus Allen for the most by a Raiders rookie in franchise history. What to know for fantasy: Cincinnati running back Joe Mixon ranks 14th in the NFL with 131 carries entering Week 11, but he is not one of the 82 players with a 20-plus-yard rush or one of the 94 players with a rushing touchdown. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: This is the second time in the past 15 seasons Oakland has been a double-digit favorite. The other came in 2017 when it was a 14-point favorite over the Jets, which it won by 25 points. Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Rams' offense this season has been a shell of its former self. Quarterback Jared Goff has a Total QBR of 29.7 -- fifth worst in the NFL -- and there's no relief in sight. The offensive line has been decimated by injuries, and three first-year starters must be prepared to line up across from a formidable Bears front, including outside linebacker Khalil Mack. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Look for Mack to bust out and flood the stat sheet against the Rams, despite just one sack in his past five games. In six prime-time games with the Bears, Mack has recorded six sacks, seven forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception return for a touchdown. And last season, Mack had a sack and forced fumble in Chicago's victory over Los Angeles. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky's 35.8 Total QBR this season is the second worst in the NFL ahead of only Tennessee backup Marcus Mariota. And Trubisky's 5.8 yards per attempt this season is the worst mark in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Todd Gurley II averaged 22.5 touches per game last season for the Rams. Yet he has a total of 22 touches over his past two games. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: All six prime-time games in the previous two weeks went over the total after prime-time games went 19-5 to the under in Weeks 1-8. Read more.",35.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill has had some big games against the Chargers, and he's on a roll of late with 17 catches for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the past two games. The Chargers are fifth in the league in passing yards allowed, so something has to give. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: The Chargers will rush for 200 yards. Melvin Gordon recorded his first 100-yard rushing game of the season last week (108) in a loss to the Raiders. The Chiefs are giving up 148 rushing yards per game, second worst in the NFL. The combination of Gordon and Austin Ekeler should create problems for Kansas City defensively. -- Eric D. Williams Stat to know: According to ESPN pass coverage metrics powered by NFL Next Gen Stats, the Chargers play zone coverage at the third-highest rate in the NFL. And Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes leads the league in yards per dropback (10.9) against zone, while also completing 80% of his passes and posting a 96 QBR. What to know for fantasy: Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers averaged 9.1 fantasy points per game against Kansas City from 2015 to 2017, but he righted the ship last season and averaged 23.7 against the divisional rival. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Rivers is 15-5-1 ATS (12-9 straight up) in prime-time games as an underdog. Read more.",56.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: While standout right tackle Lane Johnson remains in concussion protocol, the Eagles have been working rookie Andre Dillard, who has been trained at left tackle, on the right side in anticipation of Johnson's absence. Seattle defensive end Jadeveon Clowney lines up mostly on that side, which could make for a hairy day for Carson Wentz. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: The Seahawks will sack Wentz four times. That qualifies as bold for a pass rush that was a major disappointment until it got to Jimmy Garoppolo five times two weeks ago. The Seahawks are coming off a bye and finally have something close to the pass rush they envisioned with Quinton Jefferson healthy, Jarran Reed rounding into form and Clowney continuing to dominate. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Seahawks running back Chris Carson has recorded a rushing touchdown in each of his past three road games. The only Seattle players to do so in four consecutive road games over the past 15 seasons are Shaun Alexander (seven straight in 2005) and Marshawn Lynch (four straight in 2011). What to know for fantasy: Eagles tight end Zach Ertz is the only tight end to have caught at least nine passes in consecutive games this season, and three of the top four tight end performances against the Seahawks this season have come away from Seattle. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Seattle has covered in seven straight games as a road underdog, including the playoffs. It is 3-0 outright this season as a road underdog. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Falcons have 13 sacks and 25 quarterback hits over the past three games. They should be able to keep up the pressure against the Bucs' Jameis Winston, who has been sacked a league-high 36 times. An improved pass rush has allowed the Falcons to start creating turnovers, with four interceptions last weekend. Winston also has a league-high 18 picks. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Winston will throw two more interceptions against a rejuvenated Falcons defense that pressured Carolina's Kyle Allen heavily last weekend and picked him off four times. And Atlanta receivers Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley will combine for over 200 receiving yards against a young Tampa Bay secondary that's giving up 371.8 yards per game. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Bucs receiver Mike Evans is just seven yards shy of his sixth consecutive season with 1,000 receiving yards. He'd join Randy Moss (2003) as the only players in NFL history with 1,000 receiving yards in each of their first six seasons. What to know for fantasy: Atlanta's Jones has gone seven straight games without a touchdown after scoring in seven straight. The most recent time he went seven games in a row in a season without a touchdown, he responded with 25.1 fantasy points and a WR4 finish for the week. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Tampa Bay is 2-8 against the spread (ATS) this season, the worst mark in the NFL. It has failed to cover in six straight games, the longest active streak in the league. Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: This is about as ""must-win"" as it gets for the Panthers, who are now three games behind New Orleans in the NFC South after losing three of the past four. And they'll be relying on Christian McCaffrey to threaten one of the NFL's most underrated streaks: The Saints have not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 36 consecutive games, including the playoffs. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: McCaffrey will rush for 150 yards against a defense allowing only 85.3 per game. He'll do it because quarterback Kyle Allen will get back to being a game manager and relying on his playmakers instead of trying to make things happen as he has done the past four weeks, resulting in nine interceptions. -- David Newton Stat to know: Carolina's Allen has a 1-3 record, 59% completion percentage, 6.3 yards per attempt and 3-9 touchdown-to-interception ratio over the past four games. He began his season as a starter with a 4-0 record, 66% completion percentage, 7.4 yards per attempt and 7-0 TD-INT ratio. What to know for fantasy: Saints receiver Michael Thomas has been a top-15 receiver in each of his past seven games and is on pace for 379.5 fantasy points this season, a total among WRs that only Antonio Brown and Randy Moss have touched since 2003. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past five seasons, Drew Brees is 16-8 ATS in division games and 8-4 ATS at home. However, three of the four home losses came as at least nine-point favorites, including a Week 10 loss against Atlanta. Read more.",37.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How will a depleted Browns defensive line cope without three starters, including tackle Larry Ogunjobi and end Olivier Vernon, assuming the latter remains out with a knee injury? Of course, not having star pass-rusher Myles Garrett will be a challenge to overcome too -- this game and beyond. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: Cleveland's Nick Chubb will rush for a season high of 165-plus yards. The Dolphins have the 31st-ranked run defense, allowing 148.3 yards per game, and with recent injuries in the secondary, it seems possible they will overcompensate on the back end to protect their young defensive backs. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: Chubb has 607 rushing yards before first contact this season, the fourth most in the NFL. The Dolphins have allowed 653 (second most in the NFL). What to know for fantasy: Six times this season has a receiver scored more than 21 fantasy points against the Dolphins. And Odell Beckham Jr. has seen double-digit targets in consecutive games for the first time this season. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: This is the second time since the franchise returned to Cleveland in 1999 that the Browns have been a double-digit favorite. The other time was in Week 17 of 2007, when Cleveland beat San Francisco 20-7 as a 13.5-point home favorite. That is the longest drought by any team without being a double-digit favorite. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Despite sporting the league's 23rd- and 25th-ranked passing offenses, the Bills and Broncos feature the AFC's top two wide receivers by receiving yardage in John Brown and Courtland Sutton, respectively. Both teams also possess elite cornerbacks in Tre'Davious White and Chris Harris Jr., who could make things difficult for the wideouts. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: If the Broncos keep Bills quarterback Josh Allen under 50% in completion rate, they'll pull the upset. The Broncos have the league's No. 4 pass defense and rank No. 8 in scoring defense, but they have allowed a 66% completion rate overall this season. In the Bills' three losses, Allen has been held to 46.4%, 47.1% and 53.7%. Those are also the only three times he's been below 60% this season. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: The Broncos have a 28.5% conversion rate on third down this season (third worst in NFL), while the Bills have the sixth-best rate allowed (34.6%). What to know for fantasy: The Bills' Brown was the top-scoring player in fantasy last week and has over 50 receiving yards in all 10 of Buffalo's games. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Seven of 10 Buffalo games have gone under the total this season, while 14 of the past 18 Denver games have gone under. Read more.",27.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Giants have allowed 34 sacks on the season, but Chicago's star pass-rusher, Khalil Mack, is in a funk. Mack has just one sack over the past six games, and he failed to record a single tackle in the Bears' loss to the Rams last weekend. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Yes, Mack might have only 5.5 sacks this season, but he gets three Sunday against the Giants. The Giants' offensive line hasn't played well, and right tackle Mike Remmers has struggled while dealing with a back injury. It sets up for Mack to do some major damage. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: The Bears have scored the fifth-fewest points per game this season (16.9), but the Giants' defense is allowing 28.9 (third most in the NFL). What to know for fantasy: Golden Tate's WR25 average weekly finish this season is the ninth-best among qualified receivers. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: New York is 9-4 ATS on the road over the past two seasons. One of the ""road"" ATS losses came in Week 10 when it was the road team against the Jets. Ten of the 13 games went over the total. Read more.",33.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Jets can validate their two-game winning streak over bad teams with a victory over a quality opponent. Their top-ranked run defense will be tested by rookie running back Josh Jacobs. Since allowing a 66-yard run by Leonard Fournette in Week 8, the defense has allowed only 183 rushing yards on 88 carries for a 2.1 average. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: The Raiders will not allow a sack by Jets safety Jamal Adams, who is coming off a three-sack game and has six on the season. ""If you don't account for that guy,"" Raiders quarterback Derek Carr said, ""he can ruin a football game."" -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Le'Veon Bell has not rushed for more than 70 yards in any game this season, and his 1.6 rushing yards before first contact is the worst in the NFL (minimum 75 rushes). What to know for fantasy: Since Week 5, there are two running backs with multiple games of 110 rushing yards and at least three receptions: Christian McCaffrey and Jacobs (both have three such games over that stretch). See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: This is the second time in the current Jon Gruden era (since 2018) that Oakland has been a road favorite. Last season, it lost 34-3 as a 1.5-point favorite at San Francisco. Overall, Oakland is 4-8 ATS in all road games in that span (3-8 in past 11 games). Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Redskins can tie a franchise record (1960-61 seasons) if they lose their 10th straight game at home Sunday. But the Lions are 1-3-1 on the road this season and 1-21 all time when playing at Washington. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Washington quarterback Dwayne Haskins will throw three touchdown passes and two interceptions. The Lions have allowed two or more passing touchdowns in each of the past six games and haven't recorded an interception since Oct. 14. Detroit's poor pass defense continues and will give Haskins confidence, but it's not enough for Washington to win. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: The Redskins' offense is dead last in efficiency (16.5), passing yards per game (169.8) and points per game (12.5). What to know for fantasy: The Lions' Jeff Driskel is QB6 over the past two weeks, but Kenny Golladay sits at WR35 in those two games. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Washington is 1-7 ATS in its past eight games as a single-digit underdog, including 0-4 at home and 0-3 this season. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The winless Bengals host a Steelers team that has won four of its past five but is coming off last week's controversial loss at Cleveland. Both offenses are averaging less than 20 points per game. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: Benny Snell will rush for 100-plus yards. The rookie has missed the past three games after minor knee surgery, but he practiced fully Wednesday. With James Conner's aggravated shoulder injury, the Steelers once again need a running back to step up and fill his spot. The winless Bengals have the worst run defense in the NFL, allowing 167 rushing yards per game. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: The Bengals are already eliminated from postseason contention. Week 11 matches the earliest a team has been eliminated since at least 2002 (the 2014 Raiders and 2008 Lions are only teams since 2002 to be eliminated earlier by date). What to know for fantasy: Pittsburgh's Jaylen Samuels is poised for an increased role and is averaging 16.6 fantasy points for his career in games during which he gets at least 10 touches. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: In the past four seasons, home teams that are 0-5 or worse outright are 4-13 ATS. Cincinnati has lost 12 consecutive games outright (0-10 this season) but is 6-6 ATS in that span (4-6 this season). Read more.",27.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Jaguars' 29th-rated run defense (134 yards per game) will be determined to keep Derrick Henry from having another outstanding performance against it. Even though Jacksonville held Henry to only 44 yards in the previous meeting, this weekend should give offensive coordinator Arthur Smith another opportunity to focus on the running game. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Leonard Fournette will get 20 carries for the Jaguars. The Jags have neglected him the past two games (over that time, 11 first-half carries and 19 total); coach Doug Marrone said they'll be recommitted to the running game, so Fournette will get a heavy workload. It won't be easy, though. The Titans are giving up 102.5 yards per game on the ground and have allowed just five rushing scores all season. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Since Henry entered the league in 2016, no running back has scored more touchdowns against the Jaguars than Henry. In fact, his eight touchdowns are five more than the closest backs (Lamar Miller and Christian McCaffrey, with three each). What to know for fantasy: Fournette has never rushed for 70-plus yards against the Titans, and he has failed to score in three straight matchups with the division rival. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Since Ryan Tannehill became the starter, all four Tennessee games have gone over the total. When Marcus Mariota was the starter, the under was 5-1 in Tennessee games.

" What to watch for: Cowboys coach Jason Garrett noted the Patriots' knack for winning the turnover differential (No. 1 in the NFL at plus-18), while the Cowboys are minus-1 on the season (12 takeaways, 13 giveaways). The turnover battle could be key Sunday. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: Tom Brady will pass for 300 yards against the Cowboys. Brady has five 300-yard games this season but none in the past four. Since 2010, Brady has had just three five-game spans of not having at least 300 yards passing. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: The Cowboys lead the NFL in total offense this season (444.6 yards per game) and have the most efficient offense per FPI. But the Patriots lead the NFL in total defense (249.9 opponent yards per game) and have the most efficient defense per FPI. The Patriots have allowed just nine offensive touchdowns. What to know for fantasy: The Cowboys have three of the top 12 receivers over the past three weeks, but they face a Patriots defense this weekend that is allowing a league-low 22.5 fantasy points to receivers this season and is on pace to have the lowest WR fantasy points per game average against since the 2009 Jets. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: New England has covered seven consecutive games against NFC opponents, including the Super Bowl (7-1 ATS since the start of last season). Overall, Brady is 44-24-2 ATS in his career against NFC teams in the regular season. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: This will be a battle of the NFC's top two seeds and one that pits two of the sharpest young branches of the Shanahan coaching tree against each other: Kyle Shanahan and Matt LaFleur. Expect two offenses that look similar, but the team that emerges with a huge victory in the NFC playoff picture will be the one that takes better care of the ball. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: Two trends will be broken in this game: The Packers will hurt the 49ers with at least one deep ball, and it will come at the hands of Marquez Valdes-Scantling -- who despite ranking tied for second in the NFL with five catches of 40-plus yards this season has only one reception of any kind in the past three games. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: The Packers have played man coverage 56% of the time this season, the sixth-highest rate in the NFL using ESPN's coverage metrics. Niners QB Jimmy Garoppolo ranks top five in the NFL in completion rate, yards per dropback and Total QBR against man. What to know for fantasy: Excluding the injury-plagued 2017 season that saw him miss time around the bye week, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has failed to score even 16 fantasy points in the week following a bye three consecutive times. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Green Bay is 6-0 outright and 5-1 ATS against teams that entered with winning records this season. That includes two games as an underdog, which Green Bay won outright both times. Read more.",60.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Rams' defense has allowed a league-low 11 points per game over its past four games, which happens to coincide with the arrival of cornerback Jalen Ramsey. However, most of those games were against teams with struggling offenses, including the Bengals, Steelers and Bears. The Ravens come to Los Angeles as the NFL's top-scoring team, averaging 34.1 points per game. This will be the new-look Rams defense's first true test, and it'll be against a quarterback who is the front-runner to win MVP. -- Lindsay Thiry Bold prediction: Ravens cornerback Marcus Peters exacts some revenge against his former team and sets an NFL record with another pick-six. Peters would become the first player in league history to score defensive touchdowns in three consecutive road games, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: The Rams run the second-most plays per game with at least three wide receivers (52.4 per game). Without Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods last weekend, they ran just 17 snaps with three wide receivers, by far their fewest in a game in the Sean McVay era. Without those receivers, L.A. had designed runs on 62% of plays, its highest mark in the past two seasons. What to know for fantasy: The Ravens' Lamar Jackson has been a top-three quarterback seven times this season and is on pace to score 16.7 more fantasy points than Patrick Mahomes did in his historic 2018. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Since moving to Los Angeles, the Rams are 1-7-1 ATS as a home underdog (0-7-1 in their past eight games), including 0-4 with Jared Goff and 0-2 under McVay. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Two of the NFL's best teams rely on different strengths. The Ravens are the NFL's highest-scoring team at 35.1 points per game, and quarterback Lamar Jackson has led Baltimore to scores on his past 12 drives. The 49ers, meanwhile, are the league's second-stingiest defense at 14.8 points allowed per game, and San Francisco has allowed just one touchdown in its opponents' past 14 drives. Also worth watching: The Niners can clinch a playoff berth with a win and a Rams loss or tie, or a tie and a Rams loss. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Jackson will rush for 100-plus yards. He has done it three times this season and now faces a 49ers defense that has few weaknesses -- but one of them is its struggles against mobile quarterbacks. Kyler Murray and Russell Wilson averaged 8.1 yards on 19 rushes against the Niners in three games earlier this season. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: The 49ers' defense is allowing just 136.9 opponent passing yards per game this season, which is 21 yards per game fewer than the next-closest team (Patriots). If the season ended today, that mark would rank as the 16th-lowest since the 1970 merger. And every single one of those 15 teams with a better mark played in the 1970s, when teams were rushing nearly 35 times a game. What to know for fantasy: It's been the Lamar Jackson show at home this season, and while that is fun to watch, Mark Ingram II's one touchdown run on 66 home carries has been underwhelming. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is the first team to enter a game as the underdog despite holding a 10-1 record or better since Seattle (11-1) was a 2.5-point underdog at San Francisco (8-4) in 2013. In the past 30 seasons, underdogs with records of 10-1 or better are 2-11 straight up and 3-10 against the spread (ATS), including 0-9 straight up and 1-8 ATS in non-Week 17 games.

" What to watch for: The Titans have allowed only one player -- Carolina's Christian McCaffrey -- to rush for 100 yards in a game this season. But the Colts have had a player rush for at least 100 yards in a game five times this season, including back-to-back 100-yard rushing games from Jonathan Williams, who is starting in place of the injured Marlon Mack (hand). -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Tennessee's Derrick Henry will gain 100-plus rushing yards against the Colts' ninth-ranked run defense. Henry has 347 yards and four touchdowns in his past two games, but those came against poor run defenses. The last time Henry gained 100-plus yards against Indianapolis was in Week 6 of 2017. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Titans are first in red-zone touchdown percentage (13-for-14, 92.9%) since Week 7. They were ranked 18th (53.3%) in Weeks 1-6. What to know for fantasy: Indy's Williams got 29 touches last week (26 carries and three catches), a total Mack has recorded just once in his career. Williams has assumed the Mack role, and he will once again assume starter duties this weekend. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Tennessee is 3-1-1 ATS in Ryan Tannehill starts, with all five games going over the total. When Marcus Mariota started, Tennessee was 2-4 ATS, with five of the six games going under the total. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Jaguars have given up 200-plus yards rushing in three consecutive games, which makes them just the fourth team in the past decade to do so (2010 Bills, 2016 49ers, 2019 Bengals). No team has given up 200-plus yards rushing in four consecutive games since the 1986 Bucs (per ESPN Stats & Information). Tampa Bay's Ronald Jones II has never rushed for more than 80 yards in a game in his career, so this could be a big day for him, especially with linebacker Myles Jack (knee) missing practice earlier this week. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: To that end, Tampa's running backs will top 150 rushing yards for the first time this season. The Jaguars have given up 35 rushing plays of 12 or more yards and 15 rushing touchdowns this year, both the second most in the league. They're also giving up 142.3 rushing yards per game (fourth most in the league.) -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston can become the sixth player (seventh instance) in NFL history with seven consecutive games of at least 300 passing yards. And per the Elias Sports Bureau, one more touchdown will tie Winston with Peyton Manning for the second-most passing touchdowns before turning 26 years old (Manning has 111, while Dan Marino leads with 145). What to know for fantasy: Jags receiver DJ Chark Jr. has as many top-15 PPR finishes at the position as the Bucs' Chris Godwin this season (five). See Week 13 rankings.

" What to watch for: Everyone will be on high alert for tensions to flare in this rematch, but with all major actors in the infamous fight sidelined, look for a low-drama game -- at least as it relates to extracurriculars. The Steelers' defense was unremarkable in the first matchup with the Browns. Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, though, wants to rectify that this time around. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Cleveland's Odell Beckham Jr. catches two touchdowns for the first time all season, in a game otherwise defined by a series of unsportsmanlike conduct and unnecessary roughness penalties between two teams with plenty of bad blood. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: With Mason Rudolph under center, the Pittsburgh offense averaged 4.8 yards per play and 6.2 yards per pass attempt, and was 34% on third-down conversions. But with Devlin Hodges, those numbers jump to 5.3, 7.9 and 46%, respectively. What to know for fantasy: Browns running back Nick Chubb has been among the most efficient runners in the league over his career, but in his past two meetings with the Steelers, he managed just 3.5 yards per carry. See Week 13 rankings.

" What to watch for: Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers is coming off a season-worst 104 yards passing in a loss to the 49ers. But he's not facing the San Francisco defense on Sunday. Rodgers, who is fourth in the league with 10 40-plus-yard passes, gets to face a defense this week that has allowed the most such passes this season. The Giants (and Packers, whom they are tied with in the category) have both allowed 13. That sets the stage for some big plays Sunday. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: The Packers' defense -- 29th in yards allowed per game (400.1) since Week 4 and tied for last in yards allowed per play (6.5) -- will hold the Giants' 30th-ranked offense without a touchdown. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: Rodgers has a 78.1 Total QBR in his career against the Giants, the second best for him among teams he has at least four starts against (Eagles, 85.6). What to know for fantasy: Giants running back Saquon Barkley has not scored in three straight games and has averaged under 3.5 yards per carry in four straight. See Week 13 rankings.

" What to watch for: How will the Panthers adjust defensively to the loss of nose tackle Dontari Poe, whose inside push has been big for a team that ranks second in the NFL in sacks? Kyle Love likely will be first up, but don't be surprised to see Gerald McCoy and others rotate into Poe's spot. The Redskins have allowed 35 sacks, the 10th most in the NFL. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey will top 175 total yards and score once vs. the Redskins, who rank 23rd this season with 507 yards receiving allowed to opposing running backs. Washington has allowed 11 catches to backs in two games this year, and McCaffrey is the trickiest all-purpose back they will have faced, just ahead of Dalvin Cook, who had 168 all-purpose yards vs. the Redskins earlier this season. -- John Keim Stat to know: Washington's Terry McLaurin leads rookies with 638 receiving yards, is tied for the rookie lead with 40 receptions (with Deebo Samuel) and is tied for second among rookies with five touchdowns (Marquise Brown, six). With another touchdown catch, McLaurin will join Charlie Brown (eight in 1982), Chris Cooley (six in 2004) and Hugh Taylor (six in 1947) as the only Redskins players with at least six receiving touchdowns in their first NFL seasons. What to know for fantasy: The list of players this season with four straight games of 95-plus receiving yards is a short one: Michael Thomas, Cooper Kupp and Carolina's DJ Moore. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Seven of the past eight Washington games went under, including five of six under interim coach Bill Callahan. Washington has been a double-digit underdog four times during that stretch and has not scored more than nine points in those contests. Read more.",35.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Dolphins (minus-14, ranked 32nd) and Eagles (minus-5, ranked 26th) are among the bottom seven NFL teams in turnover differential. Each team is also in the bottom seven in giveaways. The Eagles have a significant talent edge, but playing sloppy football and losing the turnover battle is the main way they can keep the Dolphins in this game. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: Rookie receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside will have a breakout game and score his first touchdown. Coach Doug Pederson said the starting outside spot opposite Alshon Jeffery now belongs to Arcega-Whiteside after the release of Jordan Matthews. Arcega-Whiteside had a career-high two catches for 43 yards last week against the Seahawks. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: The Dolphins currently have a 17.5% chance to get the top pick in the 2020 NFL draft according to the FPI, the second highest behind the Bengals' 63.4%. Miami has not selected in the top three of the draft since 2013, when it took Dion Jordan at No. 3 overall. What to know for fantasy: By catching 12 passes last week against the Seahawks, the Eagles' Zach Ertz became the only active tight end to record three straight games with at least nine receptions. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past three seasons, the over is 13-5 in Ryan Fitzpatrick starts (5-3 this season). Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The once-struggling Jets have won three consecutive games as quarterback Sam Darnold has found his form. He will be matched against a Bengals secondary that allows the fourth-highest QBR to opposing quarterbacks, according to ESPN Stats & Information. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: Jets running back Le'Veon Bell will crack the 100-yard rushing mark for the first time since Dec. 17, 2017, ending a streak of 12 consecutive games under the century mark. Bell showed signs of his old form last week, and he will be facing the worst run defense in the league. The Bengals are yielding 166 rushing yards per game. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: Cincinnati's Zac Taylor would become just the fifth coach in the Super Bowl era to lose his first 12 games as a head coach, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, should the Bengals drop this one on Sunday. He could join John McKay (26), Cam Cameron (13), Jim Ringo (13) and Marty Mornhinweg (12). What to know for fantasy: In Weeks 1-10, Darnold averaged just 6.4 yards per pass attempt. Over the past two weeks, he's at 10.3 yards per pass attempt. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: New York has won and covered three straight games, all as an underdog. Read more.",37.5,LOW
" What to watch for: This will be Kliff Kingsbury's first time facing his good friend and the coach he has been compared to most, Rams coach Sean McVay. Kingsbury will want to show he can match offensive wits with McVay, so expect some more trickery while showcasing Kyler Murray more than he has this season. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Look for Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald, whose name was hardly called Monday night, to get after the mobile Murray and sack the rookie quarterback at least twice. The Cardinals had an extra week to prepare, but that won't be enough against an inspired Rams defense that is out to prove its abysmal performance in Week 12 against the Ravens was an anomaly. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: The Rams have been held under 20 points three games in a row, but they have not been held under 20 in four straight since 2016. What to know for fantasy: Murray and Lamar Jackson were the only two quarterbacks to finish Weeks 9, 10 and 11 as top-seven players at the position (Murray had a bye in Week 12). See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Arizona is 7-3-1 ATS this season, tied for the best mark in the NFL, including 5-1-1 ATS in its past seven games. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Chiefs have dominated Raiders quarterback Derek Carr at Arrowhead Stadium. He is 0-5 with three touchdowns and five interceptions. Can he turn it around against a Chiefs defense that in its last game had four interceptions against Philip Rivers and the Chargers? -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Despite having a career QBR of 9.0 at Arrowhead, Carr will have a good game, thanks in part to rookie running back Josh Jacobs, who will go over 1,000 yards rushing on the season (he needs 43 yards to reach the milestone). -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: As it stands, ESPN's FPI gives Oakland just a 16% chance to make the playoffs. A win on Sunday would move its chances up to 44%, while a loss to Kansas City bumps that down just a touch to 13%. What to know for fantasy: The Chiefs are averaging 34.4 points per game in their past three against the Raiders, but they haven't had a player rush for even 55 yards in any of those games. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Andy Reid is 26-13 ATS in division games as Kansas City's head coach, including 6-3 with Patrick Mahomes and 3-0 this season. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Broncos are coming off a dismal loss in Buffalo, where their offense closed things out with five consecutive three-and-outs. So their ability to muster anything on offense and who they start at QB will be the story the rest of the way. Still, two of the three games in which they have scored at least 23 points have been at home this season. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Playing in his home state of Colorado, Chargers running back Austin Ekeler will record more than 100 receiving yards. He leads all NFL running backs with 667 receiving yards and needs 51 more to pass Darren Sproles (1,400) for No. 8 in Chargers history among running backs. -- Eric D. Williams Stat to know: Denver quarterback Brandon Allen is completing 42% of his passes over the past two weeks (worst in NFL), and he could join Josh Rosen as the only quarterbacks this season to complete fewer than 50% of their passes in three straight weeks. What to know for fantasy: For his career, Los Angeles receiver Keenan Allen is averaging just 45.3 receiving yards per game against the Broncos, but he has scored four times in four trips to Denver. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: The under is 10-2 in Denver's past 12 home games (10-3 since the start of last season). Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Can the Texans' run defense get back on track against the Patriots? New England is averaging 3.4 yards per rush, third lowest in the NFL and on pace to be the lowest in the Tom Brady/Bill Belichick era, according to ESPN Stats & Information. But the Texans have allowed 505 rushing yards in three games without J.J. Watt. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: Brady tops his season-high total of 348 yards passing against Washington. This is a result of going against a defensive scheme he is familiar with, an increased comfort level with Isaiah Wynn back at left tackle for a second consecutive week, the projected return of receiver Phillip Dorsett II and possibly receiver Mohamed Sanu Sr., and the Texans struggling to generate consistent pressure. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: Including the playoffs, New England is 10-1 all time against the Texans, the best record by one team against a single opponent from the same conference since the 1970 merger. That includes wins in all five matchups against Houston since Bill O'Brien became the head coach in 2014 after he had previously been a Pats assistant. The Patriots have a chance to clinch a playoff berth this weekend too, through five different scenarios. What to know for fantasy: Houston's Carlos Hyde has a run gaining more than 30 yards in three straight games. On his other 41 carries over that stretch, he is averaging just 3.9 yards per carry. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson is 11-4 ATS in his career as an underdog. Read more.",38.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Seahawks' defensive resurgence over the past two games has come against offenses that were missing some key pieces -- George Kittle for the 49ers, and Alshon Jeffery, Jordan Howard and Lane Johnson for the Eagles. Minnesota's offense is fifth in Football Outsiders' DVOA rankings, and it has a chance to be at full strength with receiver Adam Thielen expected to return off the bye. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Both Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf will each haul in two receiving touchdowns. Quarterback Russell Wilson should have his way with the Vikings' pass defense, which will have had 15 days to fix some of the issues that showed up routinely in Minnesota's first 11 games. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: The Vikings have used play-action on an NFL-high 34% of their offensive plays since Week 5, and Minnesota quarterback Kirk Cousins has thrown a league-high 10 touchdowns without an interception on play-action passes over that span. What to know for fantasy: Wilson has scored more than 24 fantasy points in consecutive Week 13s, and the Vikings are allowing 26% more quarterback fantasy points per game on the road than at home this season. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past four seasons, Minnesota is 3-13-1 ATS on the road against teams that entered with winning records. Read more.",50.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: How rare is this matchup between the 10-2 Saints and 10-2 49ers? It's the first time since 2005 that two teams with two or fewer losses have met this late in the season, and only the fifth time in the past 35 years. It doesn't get much better than Sean Payton, Drew Brees, Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara facing one of the league's top-ranked defenses. And on the flip side, San Francisco's No. 2 rushing offense will have its hands full with New Orleans' No. 3 rush defense. The Niners will be seeking a playoff berth clinch with a win and a Rams loss later in the day. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: The 49ers will sack Brees at least four times. The Saints have allowed only 21 sacks this season, sixth in the NFL, but they are dealing with injuries to left tackle Terron Armstead and left guard Andrus Peat. The Niners, meanwhile, have 45 sacks, second most in the NFL, and should be looking forward to getting after a quarterback who isn't as mobile as Lamar Jackson and Russell Wilson. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: According to ESPN's pass coverage metrics powered by NFL Next Gen Stats, the 49ers use zone defense more than any other team, doing so on 69% of opposition dropbacks. And Brees has completed 80% of his pass attempts when faced with zone coverage this season, the best rate in the NFL among qualified quarterbacks. But he has thrown one touchdown and three interceptions against that scheme. What to know for fantasy: The 49ers are top-three in terms of fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks, running backs, receivers, tight ends and kickers. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is 4-0 against the spread (ATS) and 3-1 outright as an underdog this season. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo is 7-3 outright and 8-2 ATS as an underdog in his career (6-3 outright and 7-2 ATS with San Francisco). Read more.",41.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Baltimore's Lamar Jackson leads all quarterbacks in rushing yards (977 yards), while Bills QB Josh Allen leads all quarterbacks in rushing touchdowns (eight). Combined, the signal-callers' 1,405 rushing yards entering Sunday's game marks the most by opposing quarterbacks in NFL history. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Mark Ingram II, not Jackson, will lead the Ravens in rushing. Since Week 8, Buffalo has allowed the NFL's fourth-most rushing yards in between the tackles (530), and Baltimore has gained the most (718). Ingram does most of his damage with physical running inside. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: As it stands, the Ravens own the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Patriots for the top spot in the conference and hold a 69% chance to earn the AFC's No. 1 seed, per FPI. The Ravens would clinch a playoff berth with a win Sunday, and they could even lock up the AFC North with a win and a Steelers loss. The Bills, meanwhile, can clinch a playoff berth with a win and a trio of losses from the Raiders, Texans and Colts. What to know for fantasy: Jackson's athleticism generates the highlights, but he is leading the league in fantasy points per pass attempt this season. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Jackson is 7-1-1 ATS on the road in his career, including 3-0-1 as a favorite. Read more.",39.0,LOW
" What to watch for: With the Buccaneers and Colts featuring two of the better run-stopping defenses in the league, this game will likely boil down to who can sling it better: Tampa Bay's Jameis Winston or Indy's Jacoby Brissett. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: The Colts will rush for more than 160 yards for the sixth time this season despite Tampa being second in the NFL when it comes to stopping the run (76.3 yards allowed per game). Running the football gives Indianapolis its best chance to end a two-game losing streak, because it doesn't have the offensive weapons to go toe-to-toe with a Tampa offense that's averaging 28.3 points per game. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: The Colts had a 73% chance to make the playoffs coming off their Week 8 win over the Broncos, per FPI. But they have lost four of their past five games and now have a 12% chance. They have committed 11 turnovers during this span -- tied with the Buccaneers for most in the NFL -- and Brissett has posted a 40.9 QBR, which ranks 27th out of 34 qualified quarterbacks since Week 8. What to know for fantasy: Winston leads the league in points per completion this season and faces the fourth-worst defense in terms of opponent completion percentage this week. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Tampa Bay is 0-5 ATS at home this season (1-4 outright), and its past four home games went over the total. And last week snapped a streak of nine straight Tampa Bay games going over the total, regardless of location. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Minnesota running back Dalvin Cook says he'll be ready to go despite dealing with a chest injury he aggravated twice in Seattle. But if Cook is ruled out or is on a pitch count, expect a breakout game from rookie Alexander Mattison, who has shown he's fully capable and ready to shoulder a starter's workload. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Lions quarterback David Blough is sacked seven times Sunday, bringing back memories of last year when the Vikings sacked Matthew Stafford 10 times. Blough was fun to watch on Thanksgiving, but Vikings coach Mike Zimmer knows how to scheme against quarterbacks, and the Lions. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Vikings cornerback Xavier Rhodes has allowed the highest percentage of completions among defensive backs when he is the nearest defender this season (84%), according to NFL Next Gen Stats data. Oakland's Lamarcus Joyner is the second worst at 73%, more than 10 percentage points better. What to know for fantasy: Lions receiver Kenny Golladay has scored five times in his past six games and leads the NFL with 112.8 fantasy points scored on deep throws. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota is 34-14 ATS as a single-digit favorite under Mike Zimmer, including 24-7 ATS at home. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can Drew Lock beat the Texans? Defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel is 11-1 with Houston against rookie quarterbacks, the only loss coming to then-Patriots quarterback Jacoby Brissett. If Lock wins, he will be the first Broncos quarterback to win his first two career starts with the team since Trevor Siemian in 2016. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: The Broncos will run the ball more than 30 times and top 150 yards doing it. Houston defensive end J.J. Watt went on injured reserve Oct. 30, and the Texans have surrendered at least 145 yards rushing in three of their past four games. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Texans receiver DeAndre Hopkins has five receptions in 15 consecutive games, the longest such streak in Texans history. What to know for fantasy: In Lock's NFL debut, Denver receiver Courtland Sutton led all players (minimum five targets) in points per target (4.7). See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Lock is making his second career start for Denver after covering last week. Quarterbacks within their first two career starts are 15-4 ATS this season (7-2 ATS in second start). Read more.",40.0,LOW
" What to watch for: If the Packers' defense can't get right against the Redskins, then there's real trouble in Green Bay. The Packers have allowed the most plays of 40-plus yards (16 total, 14 passes and two runs) this season, while the Redskins' offense has just six such plays (tied for 22nd in the league). -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Redskins running back Derrius Guice will top 100 yards for a second consecutive game vs. a defense that allows 4.7 yards per rush -- but the Packers will apply heat on rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins. Their various looks up front will cause problems and result in ex-Redskin Preston Smith recording two more sacks and Haskins throwing an interception. -- John Keim Stat to know: With some help from Guice, the Redskins have averaged 121.9 rushing yards per game under Bill Callahan in Weeks 6-13 (10th in the NFL) after averaging 68.8 under Jay Gruden in Weeks 1-5 (27th). What to know for fantasy: Since hanging 41.6 fantasy points on the Chiefs in Week 8, Packers running back Aaron Jones has totaled just 42.1 fantasy points. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Washington has won back-to-back games outright as an underdog, including last week as a 10.5-point underdog against Carolina. Since 2000, teams coming off a win as a double-digit underdog are 28-47-3 ATS. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan stands just 34 passing yards away from becoming the 10th quarterback to reach 50,000 passing yards. It would be nice if he reaches that with a pass to Julio Jones, who needs just 50 yards for his sixth consecutive 1,000-yard season. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Panthers QB Kyle Allen, who had four interceptions in a 29-3 loss to the Falcons in Charlotte, will not have a turnover and will throw three touchdown passes in Carolina's first game since firing head coach Ron Rivera. -- David Newton Stat to know: Carolina running back Christian McCaffrey has six straight games with 100 scrimmage yards, tied for the second-longest streak in franchise history with DeAngelo Williams (McCaffrey had an eight-game streak last season). But the Panthers' run defense hasn't been as stellar. Carolina's 5.3 yards per rush allowed this season is the second most through 12 games since the 1970 merger (1976 Chiefs, 5.4). What to know for fantasy: The Falcons have won the past four games against the Panthers in Atlanta, and Ryan has averaged 24.7 fantasy points in those games. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta is 7-1 ATS and outright in the past eight meetings, including winning and covering four straight. Ryan is 9-2 ATS at home against Carolina in his career. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How motivated will the Browns be coming off the devastating loss to Pittsburgh, which destroyed their playoff chances? The home crowd won't be patient if Cleveland shows up sleepwalking against an inferior opponent. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: Cleveland receivers Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr. will have 150 combined receiving yards and two touchdowns. Cincinnati's emphasis on stopping the run should allow Cleveland's passing attack a chance to have a good day. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield is 2-0 with seven touchdowns, zero interceptions and a 94 Total QBR in his career against the Bengals. But not to be outdone, Bengals again-starter Andy Dalton has won four straight games in Cleveland (eight scores, one interception in those games). What to know for fantasy: Receiver John Ross III was activated this week for Cincinnati and brings with him a wide range of outcomes. In his first two games this season, he racked up 56 fantasy points. In his other two games? 8.8 fantasy points. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past 15 seasons, teams 1-6 or worse coming off their first wins of the season are 14-5 ATS. Earlier this season, 1-7 Miami upset Indianapolis outright as an 11-point underdog one week after its first win. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Dolphins have allowed 109 points in their past three games, so the Jets should be able to rebound from last week's disaster. New York's secondary, likely without safety Jamal Adams (ankle), will have to figure out a way to cool off Miami QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, though. The Jets have dropped four straight to Miami, sparking ""revenge"" talk in their locker room. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: Fitzpatrick will throw for more than 300 yards for the second consecutive game. Fitzpatrick is coming off his best game of the season vs. Philadelphia, and he gets a Jets defense that could be without three of its top five defensive backs, including Adams. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: Since taking over as starter in Week 7, Fitzpatrick has the third-most passing yards in the NFL (1,831) and fourth-best QBR (68.9). And he has won his past three starts against the Jets. What to know for fantasy: Jets receiver Robby Anderson is one of just four players to have seen an end zone target in each of the past three weeks. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: New York is 1-5 ATS and outright as a favorite over the past two seasons, including 0-3 this season. Read more.",54.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Jaguars did a solid job against the run last week against the Buccaneers, but Melvin Gordon and Austin Ekeler present a much tougher test for a defense giving up 137 yards per game on the ground (28th in the NFL). Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers has destroyed the Jaguars in his career, but he's struggling a bit this season. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: Chargers receiver Mike Williams will score a touchdown Sunday. After reaching the end zone 11 times last season, Williams has yet to score in 2019. However, he's made some amazing, clutch catches in late-game situations for the Chargers, and he leads the league with an average of 20.5 yards per catch. -- Eric D. Williams Stat to know: Los Angeles is seeking to avoid its first four-game losing streak since 2017, when it started the season 0-4. All eight of the Chargers' losses have come by seven or fewer points. But the Jaguars are amid their own four-game losing streak, during which their offense ranks last in the NFL at 11.8 points per game. What to know for fantasy: Jags receiver Keelan Cole led the team and posted season highs in catches (five) and receiving yards (80) in Gardner Minshew II's last start. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Los Angeles is 1-5 outright as a single-digit favorite this season (0-5-1 ATS), including 0-2 outright as a road favorite. Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: After running for 176 yards in last season's AFC Championship Game against the Chiefs, which came after rushing for 173 yards against them in the 2018 regular season, the Patriots could lean again toward more of a ground-based approach -- even though the Chiefs have a completely different defensive scheme under first-year coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. The Pats would clinch a playoff berth with a win, while the Chiefs can lock up the AFC West with a win and a Raiders loss. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: The Chiefs will intercept Tom Brady twice. Kansas City has six interceptions in its past two games, albeit against struggling quarterbacks in Philip Rivers and Derek Carr. Brady is an upgrade in competition, but the Chiefs are on a roll defensively. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: In his past two games, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has completed 56% of his passes, well below the percentage an average QB would have completed (68%), according to NFL Next Gen Stats data. He'll need to right the ship fast with the Patriots' defense on deck; it has allowed a completion percentage of just 55% this season, the best in the NFL and the best by any team through 12 games since 2012 (three teams). What to know for fantasy: Patriots running back James White doubled his season touchdown total in Week 13 and has scored over 11 points in nine of his 11 games this season. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: New England is 1-4 ATS against teams that entered with winning records this season. New England did not score more than 22 points in any of those games. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Raiders quarterback Derek Carr is 3-0 against Tennessee, passing for 841 yards with five touchdowns and one interception while completing 64.4% of his passes. All of those games have been in Nashville, so the friendly confines of the Black Hole should also serve as a boost for Carr against the Titans. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill will finish with 300 passing yards against the Raiders' pass defense, which allows 258.2 yards per game. Tannehill's arm will be the deciding factor for the Titans in their road win. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: Since Week 7, the Raiders have allowed 23 offensive touchdowns (second worst in the NFL) and 162 first downs (worst). And the Titans are tied for second in red zone efficiency during their current three-game winning streak. What to know for fantasy: Tennessee running back Derrick Henry has 13 rushing touchdowns and six runs of 30-plus yards over his past eight November/December games (168 carries). Over that same stretch, the preseason ""Big Four"" running backs (Christian McCaffrey, Saquon Barkley, Alvin Kamara and Ezekiel Elliott) have 13 rushing scores and six runs of 30-plus yards (507 carries). See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: All six of Tannehill's starts have gone over the total. He is 4-1-1 ATS this season. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Cardinals will be playing what could feel like a road game in their own stadium because of how many Steelers fans live in Arizona or will travel for the game. That will play a major factor Sunday and likely cause the Cardinals to go with a silent count and struggle. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: The Steelers' tight ends will outscore the Cardinals. Arizona is notoriously bad at defending tight ends, making this a prime game for both Vance McDonald and Nick Vannett. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: The Cardinals have lost five straight games, but quarterback Kyler Murray has been a bright spot. He has four games this season with 300 passing yards. One more such game would give him the second most by a rookie since the 1970 merger. What to know for fantasy: Pittsburgh's James Washington is the 10th-best receiver in fantasy over the past four weeks and is averaging 21.8 yards per catch over that stretch. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Since quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's injury, Pittsburgh is 6-2-2 ATS, and the under is 8-2 in those games. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: When these teams met in Week 5, the Seahawks won 30-29. The Seahawks are 9-1 in one-score games this season, and Sunday's game is likely to be another thriller, with the Seahawks trying to earn home-field advantage in the playoffs and the Rams needing a win to keep their postseason hopes alive. A win for Seattle secures a playoff berth. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Seahawks running back Rashaad Penny will find the end zone again. No longer buried behind Chris Carson the way he was for most of his first season and a half, Penny has seen a near-even split in playing time with Carson over the past two weeks. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Rams quarterback Jared Goff and the Rams aren't using the play-action pass much this season. They've used it on 28% of their plays after leading the league at 36% last year. What to know for fantasy: Penny is RB4 over the past two weeks, just 0.3 points behind Saquon Barkley and Todd Gurley II combined over that stretch. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson is 30-15-1 ATS in his career against teams that entered with winning records, including 15-4-1 ATS on the road. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Eagles are 0-3 since losing Jordan Howard to a shoulder stinger in Week 9, and he has still not been cleared for contact. Coach Doug Pederson hasn't been as trusting of his ground game in Howard's absence, though Miles Sanders' clear development as a runner in recent weeks should change that. Expect a heavy dose of the rookie on Monday night. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Sanders outrushes his close friend and former Penn State teammate Saquon Barkley. Sanders is coming off a career-best 83 yards rushing and 17 carries against the Dolphins. Barkley also had 83 yards rushing last week against the Packers, but the Giants have struggled to run the ball, and it was his best output since Week 2. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz has a 15-game streak with a passing touchdown, tied for the longest active streak in the NFL with Russell Wilson. And Wentz has a 4-1 record against Eli Manning, with four being his most wins vs. another starting QB. What to know for fantasy: Barkley does not have a rush gaining more than 27 yards since ripping off a 59-yarder in Week 1. The top overall pick in fantasy drafts this summer has failed to score in four straight games and is averaging just 4.0 yards per carry this season (5.0 as a rookie). See Week 14 rankings.

" What to watch for: Tennessee is averaging 31.7 points per game at home with Ryan Tannehill under center. And the Titans have rolled up 30 points or more in each of their past four games. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Titans running back Derrick Henry will show just how much the Texans miss J.J. Watt. Henry has topped 100 rushing yards in four consecutive games and does so again on Sunday. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: The Texans have allowed opponents to convert 49% of their third downs this season, worst in the NFL and on track to be the worst in franchise history (44% in 2006). What's at stake: This is the first of two games over the next three weeks that will decide the AFC South. The winner this week will be a game up but won't clinch anything. At the moment, FPI is favoring the Texans (67.1%) to wind up as division champions. That number would increase to 90% with a victory. Betting nugget: Tennessee is 6-1 (5-1-1 against the spread, or ATS) since Tannehill took over as the starter, including four straight wins and covers. All seven games went over the total.

" What to watch for: The Packers boast the best pass-block win rate in the NFL this season at 70%, according to ESPN Stats & Information data powered by NFL Next Gen Stats. And Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers has averaged almost three seconds to throw this season. Yet to hear Packers coach Matt LaFleur tell it, the Bears' defense has ""got guys that can completely wreck a game."" -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Bears wide receiver Allen Robinson II will catch at least one touchdown pass. Robinson -- Chicago's top receiver with 76 receptions for 898 yards and seven TDs -- leads the NFL with four receiving touchdowns over the past three weeks. He is also on pace to become the Bears' first 1,000-yard receiver since Alshon Jeffery in 2014. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: In Mitchell Trubisky's past five games, the quarterback has helped lead the Bears to a 4-1 record while completing 67% of his passes for 245 passing yards per game and 11 passing touchdowns. In his first seven games, he was completing 63% of his passes for 174 passing yards per game and five passing scores. His 11 passing TDs since Week 10 quietly ranks as the fourth most in that span (Lamar Jackson, 16; Drew Brees, 12; Jimmy Garoppolo, 12). What's at stake: The Packers can clinch a playoff berth with a win or tie and a Rams loss. The Bears, on the other hand, are fighting to avoid elimination from playoff contention. That would happen with a loss and a win by either the Vikings or Rams. Betting nugget: Rodgers is 14-6 ATS as a favorite against Chicago. Over the past five seasons, Green Bay is 13-4 ATS as a home favorite of less than seven points. Read more.",37.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Chiefs are playing much better defense of late (14 points allowed per game over the past three), but the Broncos and rookie quarterback Drew Lock might represent their biggest challenge during this stretch. Don't be surprised if the Chiefs blitz Lock relentlessly, as they did last week with the Patriots' Tom Brady. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: The Broncos have surrendered at least three sacks in eight games this season; this will be the ninth. After two games in which opposing defensive coordinators did little extra to pressure Lock or to disguise their coverages, the rookie will feel the heat from the Chiefs. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes has three consecutive games with exactly one passing touchdown. He had two games all of last season without multiple throwing scores (Weeks 4-5) compared with six such games this season. Mahomes' 5.4% touchdown rate this season is way off last season's 8.6%. What's at stake: The Chiefs already have won the AFC West but have a chance to improve their seeding considerably. They are still in the running for the No. 1 overall seed because they hold head-to-head tiebreakers over both the Ravens and the Patriots. The Broncos could be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss, a Steelers win or a tie between the Texans and Titans. Betting nugget: Lock is 2-0 as a starter, winning as a 7.5-point underdog against the Texans and as a 4.5-point underdog against the Chargers. In the Super Bowl era, the only quarterbacks to begin their careers 3-0 all as an underdog are Mahomes and Kyle Allen. Lock would be the first rookie in that span to do it. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bengals have the second-worst scoring offense, while New England has the best scoring defense. However, both teams struggle at the line of scrimmage, which could make things more interesting than expected. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: The Patriots will hit 30 points for the first time since a 33-0 win over the Jets on Oct. 21 -- a span of six games. If they don't hit the 30-point mark against the Bengals, it would tie the longest streak in the Bill Belichick/Tom Brady era of consecutive sub-30-point games (2002, 2005). -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: Cincinnati running back Joe Mixon has three rushing touchdowns in his past four games. He had none prior to that this season. What's at stake: All the Patriots can do this week is clinch a playoff berth with a win or a tie in Cincinnati. And the Bengals continue to hold a two-game edge for the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. FPI gives them a 70% chance of landing that spot. Betting nugget: New England has lost back-to-back games entering this week. Brady is 41-19 ATS in his career after a loss, and he is 8-4 ATS in his career on the heels of a multigame losing streak. Read more.",40.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Can the Panthers tighten up a run defense that ranks 29th in the league as it faces the league's third-best rushing attack? If past trends continue, the Seahawks will gash Carolina for big runs and at least equal their 140.8 yards rushing per game. -- David Newton Bold prediction: The Seahawks will take a page out of Rams coach Sean McVay's playbook ... sort of. McVay got Jared Goff out of the pocket on designed rollouts several times Sunday night, one reason he wasn't sacked and took only four official hits. Russell Wilson, meanwhile, took five sacks and 11 hits. Now he faces one of the NFL's most productive pass rushes, with Carolina ranking second in sacks at 47. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: During the Panthers' current five-game losing streak, they have a minus-12 turnover margin (worst in the NFL) and 31.8 QBR (28th), and they're allowing 6.5 yards per play (31st in NFL). What's at stake: The Seahawks can clinch a playoff berth with a win and a loss by either the Rams or Vikings. Another less likely clinching scenario is a win along with a Packers loss and a tie by the Vikings. The Panthers have been eliminated, and a loss would elevate their chances of a top-10 draft pick. FPI projects it as a 49.7% likelihood. Betting nugget: Wilson is 23-12-2 ATS in his career after a loss (30-7 outright). Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Lions star receiver Kenny Golladay has been quiet of late. But with Marvin Jones Jr. out for the year, the third-year pro could go for over 100 yards and score two touchdowns for Detroit in a game few fans will come out to see. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Even with a broken right thumb, Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston will have just his fifth interception-free game of the season. Even with Pro Bowler Darius Slay in their secondary, the Lions have only five interceptions this season, tied for fewest in the league. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: The Bucs are seeking their first four-game win streak since 2016, when they won five straight. During the current streak, they are averaging 434.3 yards per game and have forced seven turnovers (second and tied for second, respectively, in the NFL over that span). What's at stake: A Week 15 battle between two eliminated teams doesn't offer much other than draft position consideration. The Lions could improve their 50-50 odds (via FPI) of a top-five pick, while the Buccaneers could risk falling out of the top 15 with a victory. Betting nugget: Detroit has lost six straight games and has failed to cover in seven of its past eight. Meanwhile, this is the most points Tampa Bay has been favored by on the road since Week 1 of 2013 against the Jets (the Bucs lost by one as 3.5-point favorites). Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Redskins rank 10th in rushing yards per game since Bill Callahan became the interim coach in Week 6. But in the past five games vs. the Eagles -- all losses -- they've averaged 58.4 rushing yards per game and 4.0 per carry (and only 2.8 per carry aside from Adrian Peterson's 90-yard touchdown run last season). Meanwhile, Philadelphia ranks third in rushing yards allowed per game this season. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Philadelphia's Boston Scott will score two touchdowns. The second-year back burst onto the scene Monday night against the Giants, racking up 156 all-purpose yards and a touchdown. That should be enough to elevate him over Jay Ajayi on the depth chart, and he'll be eager to take advantage of the opportunity. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Peterson needs one rushing touchdown to tie Hall of Famer Walter Payton for fourth on the all-time list, along with 65 rushing yards to tie Hall of Famer Curtis Martin for fifth in that category. What's at stake: The Eagles have a real chance to overtake the Cowboys for the top spot in the NFC East with a win, along with a Dallas loss to the Rams. A win gives the Eagles a 39% chance to win the NFC East, according to FPI (would drop to 15% with a loss). A Redskins win, on the other hand, could risk their otherwise solid standing for a spot in the top five of the draft. Betting nugget: Philadelphia has won five straight meetings, all by at least five points. It's 4-1 ATS in those games, with the only non-cover coming in Week 1 this season (Philadelphia won by five as a 10-point favorite after falling behind 17-0). Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Giants running back Saquon Barkley said he's feeling ""healthier and healthier"" each week. And this week, he gets to face the league's 31st-ranked run defense. This is setting up for a big week for Barkley, who hasn't rushed for 100 yards since Week 2. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Patrick Laird will be the first Dolphins running back to reach 100 total yards in a game this season. Laird has emerged as the Dolphins' clear lead back and had a career-high 86 total yards vs. the Jets. He'll look to take advantage of a suspect secondary Sunday. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: Barkley has 610 rushing yards this season. He has never had a sub-1,000-yard rushing season in either college or the NFL. What's at stake: A Dolphins win could jeopardize their spot among the top five picks in the draft. They have a 5.7% chance at the No. 1 pick still, per FPI, but a win would eliminate any shot. The Giants, meanwhile, have the second-best chance to pick No. 1 overall behind the Bengals (19.7%). Chances would increase to 40% with a loss to the Dolphins, or fall to 9% with a win. Betting nugget: New York is the eighth team in the past 30 seasons to be a favorite despite entering on a losing streak of at least nine games. The previous seven were 1-6 outright and ATS. The last time it happened was in Weeks 13-14 of 2016, when Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers lost twice as favorites. The current 3.5-point spread would be the largest ever in favor of a team on a losing streak of at least nine games. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Chargers face the fourth-leading rusher in the NFL in Dalvin Cook (1,108) on Sunday. Defensively, they have held teams to 98 rushing yards per game since Week 8, seventh best in the NFL. The Chargers' ability to slow down Cook should determine who wins this game. -- Eric D. Williams Bold prediction: Minnesota receiver Adam Thielen delivers a statement performance in his first game in nearly two months, recording two touchdowns in L.A. The Chargers have one of the league's best pass defenses, but this unit is going to sell out to stop Cook, thus leaving Thielen able to win his one-on-one matchups. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins has a 49.4 Total QBR in road games this season (20th in NFL), compared to 75.4 at home (fourth in NFL). What's at stake: The Vikings can't clinch anything in Week 15, but they almost certainly need a win to maintain their slim chances to overtake the Packers in the NFC North (30% chance per to FPI). A loss, combined with a win by the Rams, would make things interesting for the No. 6 seed. And a loss for the Chargers would give them a better chance of earning a top-10 pick in the draft. FPI projects that possibility at 38.9%. Betting nugget: Since acquiring Cousins, Minnesota is 1-6-1 outright and 1-7 ATS when the spread is in the range of +3 to -3. Read more.",54.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Arizona's Kyler Murray and Cleveland's Baker Mayfield will have a shootout Sunday at State Farm Stadium as each tries to one-up the other. The two close friends know their teams need to win this game, but both will want to prove who's the best former Heisman-winning Oklahoma quarterback to be selected first in the NFL draft. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Browns receiver Odell Beckham Jr. will have a season-low number of targets (four or fewer), but the Browns' offense will put up more than 30 points for only the third time this season. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: Cleveland's Nick Chubb has at least 75 yards from scrimmage in all 13 games this season. He's the only player in the NFL to do so, and he's tied with Jim Brown (1961) and Reuben Droughns (2005) for the most such games in a single season in Browns history. But the yardage isn't piling up throughout the offense: Beckham has seven straight games under 100 receiving yards, the longest streak of his career. What's at stake: The Browns can be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss and a Steelers win, or a loss and a tie between the Texans and Titans. The Cardinals, losers in six consecutive games, are on their way to locking in a top-five draft pick for the second consecutive year. Betting nugget: This is the seventh straight game in which Cleveland has been favored -- its longest streak since 1994. It was a road favorite twice in that stretch and lost both games outright. Read more.",59.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: In what is likely the final Raiders game at the Oakland Coliseum, look for the Raiders to ride a wave of emotion to end their ghastly three-game losing streak. And if rookie running back Josh Jacobs (shoulder) plays as expected, look for him to cement his status as the NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Year against the No. 30 run defense. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: Even with a banged-up shoulder, Jacobs will set a career high in rushing yards. He had 124 against Green Bay but will top that against a Jaguars run defense that is giving up an average of 193.6 yards per game in its past five games. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Jacksonville's Leonard Fournette has 1,039 rushing yards yet only three rushing touchdowns. Every other player with 1,000-plus rush yards has at least five scores. And only two players since 2010 have rushed for over 1,000 yards and scored three or fewer rushing TDs (C.J. Anderson in 2017 and Darren McFadden in 2015). What's at stake: The Raiders can be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss and a Steelers win, or a loss and a tie between the Texans and Titans. The Jaguars are a relative lock for a top-10 draft pick, but a loss would increase their chances to move up into the top five. Betting nugget: Jacksonville has lost five straight games, all by at least 17 points (0-5 ATS). It was never more than a 4.5-point underdog in any of those games. Meanwhile, Oakland has lost three straight games, all by at least 21 points, and it has failed to cover in four straight games. Read more.",41.5,LOW
" What to watch for: When these teams met in the playoffs this past January, the Rams ran all over the Cowboys with 273 yards on 48 carries. C.J. Anderson and Todd Gurley II each had more than 100 yards. And now the Cowboys have allowed at least 100 yards rushing in seven consecutive games. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Gurley will finally reach the 100-yard rushing mark. Rams coach Sean McVay has dramatically increased the running back's touches over the past four weeks as the Rams make a late push toward a third consecutive playoff berth, and indications are that McVay will call Gurley's number early and often against a Cowboys rushing defense that's allowing an average of 104.3 yards per game. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Cowboys QB Dak Prescott has had 23 passes dropped by receivers this season, the most for any QB in the league. What's at stake: The Cowboys hold a temporary tiebreaker over the Eagles in the NFC East, but all it will take is one loss combined with one Eagles victory to reverse the top of the division standings. According to FPI, the Cowboys have a 67% chance to win the NFC East. That improves to 74% with a win over the Rams, and it drops to 54% with a loss. The Rams, meanwhile, have staved off playoff elimination and are one more win -- combined with a Vikings loss -- from jumping into the No. 6 seed. They have a 25% chance to make the playoffs. Betting nugget: Los Angeles is 5-2 outright and ATS since acquiring cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Six of the seven games went under. Overall, seven of Los Angeles' past eight games went under. Read more.",56.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This could be a trap game for the Niners as they deal with a series of key injuries, are coming off an emotional and exhausting win in New Orleans and are hosting a team that knows coach Kyle Shanahan well. How the 49ers deal with all of that in a game that could clinch them a playoff spot will go a long way in determining the winner. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: Vic Beasley Jr. will get three sacks to give him a team-high nine on the season, including five in the past two games. And there will be more buzz generated about where this was from Beasley all season and if he's worth re-signing. -- Vaughn McClure Stat to know: Niners running back Raheem Mostert has a rushing touchdown in three straight games. The last 49ers player with one in four straight was Frank Gore (Weeks 4-8 of 2011). What's at stake: The 49ers can clinch a playoff berth with a win or tie. Even if they let down and lose, they can clinch if the Rams lose, or if the Vikings and Packers lose. And a Falcons loss would all but lock up a top-10 pick in the draft. Betting nugget: San Francisco has not been more than a 10-point favorite since 2014. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo is 1-5-1 ATS with San Francisco as a favorite of at least six points and 11-2-1 ATS in all other games. Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Steelers' offense figures to be its healthiest since the Monday night win against the Dolphins in late October, though JuJu Smith-Schuster will miss another game. James Conner practiced this week, and against a Bills defense ranked No. 3 in yards allowed per game, the Steelers need as many weapons at their disposal as possible. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: The Steelers have won the turnover battle in all but two games this season. But the Bills not only will win the turnover battle Sunday night, their defense will score its first touchdown of the season. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: Since Week 4, the Steelers' defense has been lights out. It has allowed the NFL's lowest Total QBR (34) and fewest yards per play (4.3). It also has led the league with 26 takeaways and 42 sacks in that time, and only the Patriots have a better defensive efficiency over that span. What's at stake: The Bills can clinch a playoff spot, their second in three seasons, with a win. The Steelers need a win to continue fighting off the Texans and the surging Titans, though. They have a 59% chance to make the playoffs, per FPI. Betting nugget: Since the NFL expanded to 32 teams in 2002, Buffalo's 3-17 record in prime-time games is the worst in the NFL over that span (lost past five games). It's 7-12-1 ATS in those games, including 0-2 under coach Sean McDermott. Read more.",20.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Saints almost certainly need to win out to have any shot at the NFC's No. 1 seed after last week's gut-wrenching 48-46 loss to the 49ers. But at least they did get Drew Brees and the offense going, which they hope to continue in a setting where he has thrived over the years: at home on Monday Night Football. The Colts (6-7) have fallen on hard times with losses in five of their past six games. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: The Saints, fifth in the NFL in sacks with 43, will have their eighth game with at least three sacks. The Colts have given up three sacks in a game only once this season. Running the ball is one way to keep the pressure off Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett, but the Saints are good against the run too, giving up only 94.2 yards per game. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: After missing two games with a broken hand, Colts running back Marlon Mack was held to a season-low 38 yards in Week 14 against Tampa Bay. Mack gained a season-low 17 yards before initial contact and was hit at or behind the line of scrimmage on seven of his 13 rushes after averaging 50.8 rush yards before contact per game, fifth most among running backs, entering the contest. What's at stake: The Colts can be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss. The Saints already have clinched the NFC South but need to keep winning as they chase home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Betting nugget: Indianapolis coach Frank Reich is 9-1 ATS and 8-2 outright in the regular season against teams with winning records, but the only ATS loss came in Week 13 against Tennessee. He is 6-0 ATS against teams that entered at least two games over .500. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Titans' secondary will be trying to find a way to slow down Saints receiver Michael Thomas, who could set the single-season receptions record (143) if he catches 10 passes. The Titans will mix zone and man coverage against New Orleans. When the Titans go man, expect Thomas to be double-teamed. Zone coverage against Drew Brees is asking for trouble, but maybe Tennessee's pass rush can get home to force a couple of bad throws and a rare interception. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: The Saints will hold Derrick Henry under 100 rushing yards, bringing their remarkable streak to 41 games without allowing a 100-yard rusher, including the playoffs. This could be their toughest test yet, though, since they placed two of their top defensive linemen on injured reserve last week -- and because Henry is averaging a whopping 137 rushing yards over the past five games. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill has completed 71.5% of his passes this season, but according to NFL Next Gen Stats, his expected completion percentage is 62.9%. He has the highest completion percentage above expectation for any quarterback with 100 attempts over the past four seasons, per NFL Next Gen Stats. What's at stake: The Saints need a win to maintain their best chance to elevate in the NFC standings, where they currently trail the Packers via tiebreakers. The Titans can neither clinch nor be eliminated from a playoff spot until Week 17. Betting nugget: New Orleans has won and covered five straight road games. Over the past two seasons, New Orleans is 10-3 ATS on the road. However, Tennessee is 4-2 outright as a home underdog under Mike Vrabel. Read more.",56.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Ravens have home-field advantage -- as well as revenge from the early-season loss to Cleveland -- to play for. The Browns essentially have nothing. This quickly could turn into a rather tense scene in front of a frustrated Cleveland fan base that could use this opportunity to voice its displeasure with perhaps the NFL's biggest disappointment. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: The Browns allow a season-worst 280 yards rushing. Over the past four games, Baltimore has averaged a league-best 199.7 yards rushing, and Cleveland has given up 155.3 yards rushing per game (third worst in the NFL). Lamar Jackson and Mark Ingram II will both record 100 yards rushing. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: The Ravens have a league-leading 2,830 rushing yards this season, 772 more than the next closest team (San Francisco). Baltimore needs 335 more in their final two games to match the all-time single-season record of 3,165 rushing yards set by the 1978 Patriots. What's at stake: The Ravens can clinch home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs with a win. If the Ravens lose and the Chiefs lose, the Ravens will clinch at least the No. 2 seed and thus a first-round bye. The Browns, meanwhile, could have their thin playoff hopes officially dashed with a loss; or with wins by either the Steelers or Titans; or by a Colts loss. Betting nugget: Cleveland is the second team in the Super Bowl era to be a double-digit home underdog to a team it beat by at least 14 points earlier in the season. The other time was in 1988, when Green Bay upset Minnesota 34-14 in Week 7, then won the Week 15 rematch 18-6 as a 10.5-point home underdog. Read more.",55.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This is Atlanta's final home game and a chance for the Falcons to leave a strong last impression as they fight to keep coach Dan Quinn's job. Losing the final home game would be a bad look for him, and the players know Quinn's position is on the line. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Falcons tight end Austin Hooper will surpass 100 yards receiving. Opposing quarterbacks have a 126.9 passer rating when targeting tight ends against the Jaguars, per ESPN Stats & Information data. That is the second highest in the league (Arizona, 137.6), and the Jaguars are coming off a game in which Oakland tight end Darren Waller caught eight passes for 122 yards. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: The Jaguars have four losses by 20-plus points this season, tied for the most in the NFL. And since Week 9, the Jaguars' minus-113 point differential is by far the worst in the NFL. What's at stake: Both teams have been eliminated from playoff contention. The Jaguars already have fired executive vice president Tom Coughlin, and it is hard to imagine that coach Doug Marrone's status will be impacted by strong performances in the final two games of the season. Betting nugget: Over the past five seasons, Jacksonville is 8-2 ATS as an underdog of at least seven points (regular season plus playoffs), including an outright win last week in Oakland. Meanwhile, since 2012, Atlanta is 3-13 ATS as a favorite of at least seven points. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will the Colts' defense attack third-round quarterback Will Grier, who will lean heavily on Christian McCaffrey to help take some of the load off his shoulders? The opportunity to pass could be there for Grier because the Colts have given up 774 yards and seven touchdowns on 64 of 79 passing the past two games. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Grier will feed the ball to McCaffrey to the tune of 11 catches for 105 yards and two touchdowns, win his NFL debut and get the Pro Bowl running back within 81 receiving yards of becoming the third player in NFL history to have 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season. -- David Newton Stat to know: With six catches, McCaffrey would become the first running back with multiple 100-reception seasons in NFL history. And with seven, he would tie the second-most receptions through a player's first three seasons in NFL history (behind Michael Thomas). What's at stake: Both teams have been eliminated from playoff contention. The Panthers have a 60.0% chance of a top-10 draft pick and therefore have more incentive to lose. Betting nugget: Quarterbacks making their first career starts are 9-2 ATS this season. And QBs making their first or second career start are 18-5 ATS. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Don't expect a lot of scoring. The Steelers are fourth in total defense and the Jets are ninth. The return of Pro Bowl safety Jamal Adams will spark the Jets, who will feel like visitors in their own stadium due to an anticipated invasion of Pittsburgh fans. Crowd noise could hurt the Jets' offense, which will have a hard time blocking edge rushers T.J. Watt and Bud Dupree. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: The Jets' Le'Veon Bell rushes for more yards than the Steelers' running backs. Despite dressing five backs and the return of James Conner, the Steelers ran the ball only 15 times a week ago. The Jets have the second-best rushing defense in the NFL, making it even more difficult to run the ball this week. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: All four of Pittsburgh quarterback Devlin Hodges' interceptions last week were on passes more than 10 yards downfield, and he was just 4-for-10 on such throws. What's at stake: Currently in the AFC's No. 6 seed, the Steelers can neither clinch nor be eliminated from a playoff spot. And the Jets have an 88.8% chance to draft in the top 10, according to FPI, but only a 1.9% chance to move into the top five. Betting nugget: All four Hodges starts have gone under the total. Overall, six straight Pittsburgh games have gone under the total, with none of those games combining for more than 40 points. Read more.",30.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Which 3-11 team wants to win more -- or less? Both teams will make big changes in the offseason, and the loser of this game will be in far better draft position -- possibly in the second spot, where they might have a shot at Ohio State defensive end Chase Young. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Dwayne Haskins and Daniel Jones combine for five touchdowns without a turnover. Call it a hunch. It would be something, though, considering the two rookies have combined for 30 turnovers this season. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: In a career day last week against the Eagles, Haskins threw for 104 yards and a touchdown on play-action. Haskins also finished with 146 yards on throws of more than 10 yards downfield, a career high. What's at stake: The Giants want to preserve their current 91.5% chance to pick in the top five of the draft (via FPI), but the Redskins have a higher goal. They have a 5.2% chance to land the top pick if the Bengals surge. Betting nugget: Washington has lost eight straight division games, going 1-7 ATS in that span. Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Bengals are in the driver's seat for the No. 1 pick in the 2020 draft. A Dolphins win clinches the No. 1 pick for Cincinnati, while likely moving Miami toward the back end of the top five. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: Joe Mixon will rush for 150 yards. The Bengals' running back is on a hot streak and the Dolphins are next-to-last in the league in rushing defense. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Mixon has at least 125 rushing yards in consecutive games. No Bengals running back has ever recorded three straight such games. What's at stake: The Bengals are the overwhelming 81.5% favorite to select first in the 2020 draft, according to FPI. The Dolphins have a 6.9% chance of moving into that spot with a loss but are currently projected to choose No. 3. Betting nugget: Miami has been the only team to be an underdog in every game this season. Brian Flores is the second coach to begin his career as an underdog in his first 15 career games in the past 10 years (Gus Bradley was an underdog in his first 30). Read more.",33.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Chargers will play their final game in the team's temporary home in Carson, the 27,000-seat Dignity Health Sports Park. While fans enjoyed the intimate setting and up-close view, the Chargers did not have a home-field advantage, with opposing team's fans regularly taking over the stadium. The Chargers are 11-10 at home since moving to L.A. three years ago. -- Eric D. Williams Bold prediction: Erik Harris will pick off Philip Rivers ... again. The Raiders' safety got the Chargers' quarterback twice in the first meeting this season, including a 56-yard pick-six, and could have had two more interceptions were it not for a penalty and a tipped pass. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Rivers has 47 career passing touchdowns vs. the Raiders, and he can become fifth QB with 50 passing TDs against a single opponent in NFL history (Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Eli Manning and Brett Favre). What's at stake: All but eliminated from the AFC playoff race, the Raiders could make it official with a loss. It could also happen with wins by either the Steelers or Titans, or a Colts loss. The Chargers need a loss to stay on track for a top-10 draft pick. FPI gives them a 60.6% chance to do it. Betting nugget: Los Angeles is 0-4 ATS and outright in division games despite being favored in three of those games. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: With a Lions defense that has surrendered at least 275 yards passing 10 times this season and more than 400 yards twice in the past five games, expect the Broncos to let Drew Lock let it fly. The rookie Denver quarterback has attempted 28, 27 and 40 passes in his first three starts, and it's likely he'll throw early and often in this one. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Lock throws for his second 300-yard game along with two touchdowns against a beat-up Lions defense. Against Detroit's porous pass defense, though, that might not be all that bold. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Lions quarterback David Blough threw a touchdown on each of his first two drives as the starter. But now he has just one passing touchdown in the past 34 Detroit drives. What's at stake: Both teams are eliminated from the playoffs, but Lions coach Matt Patricia already knows he will return in 2020. There has been no official confirmation of Broncos coach Vic Fangio's future, but it has been presumed that he will get more than one year to turn around the Broncos. Betting nugget: Detroit is 1-8 ATS in its past nine games and has lost seven straight games outright. Read more.",38.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz leads the league in red zone touchdowns (eight) over the past three weeks despite missing many of his top options. Dallas' defense, meanwhile, has yielded touchdowns on 70% of opponents' trips to the red zone over the past three games -- a far more generous rate than their season average of 52%. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Cowboys receiver Amari Cooper will have more than 100 receiving yards. It's meaningful because Cooper's numbers are not the same away from AT&T Stadium. He has just 23 catches for 296 yards and three touchdowns in seven road games this season. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: On throws at least 15 yards downfield, Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott been among the league leaders in completion percentage (52%, third), yards per attempt (15.0, third) and touchdowns (14, first). What's at stake: This one is pretty simple. The Cowboys can clinch the NFC East and eliminate the Eagles from playoff contention with a win. An Eagles win shifts the race to Week 17. Betting nugget: Philadelphia is 0-2 at home as an underdog this season. It is 0-4 outright as a home underdog against Dallas since upsetting Dallas in 1999 as a 10-point underdog. Current coach Doug Pederson was Philadelphia's starting quarterback in that game. Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Keep an eye on Seahawks linebacker Shaquem Griffin chasing Kyler Murray. Griffin has become a regular in the Seahawks' pass-rush rotation over the past five games, and Pete Carroll gave what seemed like a hint that he could factor heavily into this game because of how his speed matches with that of Murray. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Murray will throw for two touchdowns and run for another while proving that the noise in Seattle isn't too much for him. But the Seahawks will win on a last-second field goal. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: Murray has recorded 3,279 passing yards and 504 rushing yards this season. With 221 more passing yards, he would become the sixth different quarterback with 3,500 passing yards and 500 rushing in a season in NFL history -- and he would join Cam Newton (2011) as the only rookies to do it. What's at stake: The Seahawks have clinched a playoff spot but need a victory to ensure the possibility that they can play the 49ers in Week 17 with the NFC West title -- and likely No. 1 overall seed -- in the balance. Arizona, on the other hand, is looking at the likelihood of a pick in the top 10 of the draft, according to FPI, with an 18.6% chance of moving up. Betting nugget: Seattle has won only one game this season by more than eight points. However, that lone double-digit win came in its Week 4 meeting against Arizona, winning 27-10 as a 5.5-point favorite. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It's Mitchell Trubisky vs. Patrick Mahomes. The battle of quarterbacks on Sunday night means nothing to Chiefs fans. In Chicago, it means everything. The last thing the Bears want is a three-hour prime-time infomercial focused on how the Bears messed up by drafting Trubisky over Mahomes (and Deshaun Watson) back in 2017. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Terrell Suggs will get a sack in his Chiefs debut. The Chiefs are down two of their top defensive ends because of injuries, so they need Suggs to step in and play a significant role. He'll get his chances to sack Trubisky. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Trubisky has five straight games with an interception, the longest active streak in the NFL. What's at stake: The Chiefs have won the AFC West, but their playoff seeding is far from settled. The Bears were eliminated last week. Betting nugget: Over the past three seasons, Chicago is 6-1-1 ATS as a home underdog with four outright wins. Read more.",41.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Minnesota running back Dalvin Cook is unlikely to play, according to league sources, and backup Alexander Mattison's status for Week 16 is unclear. If the Vikings want to keep their running game going, they might have to go through Mike Boone, Minnesota's No. 3 back, who ran for 56 yards and two touchdowns in Los Angeles. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins is 0-8 on Monday Night Football, the worst record by any quarterback (according to the Elias Sports Bureau), and Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers has won his past five starts on MNF. Both of those streaks will halt at U.S. Bank Stadium, where Rodgers has more broken collarbones than victories. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: The Vikings have been great at minimizing running backs and tight ends in the passing game. When defending those two positions, opponents have the third-lowest Total QBR (41), the lowest completion percentage (67%), the second-fewest yards per attempt (5.9) and the lowest TD-to-INT ratio (0.71). But when defending wide receivers, opponents have the highest total QBR (93), the sixth-highest completion percentage (68%), the 14th-most yards per attempt (8.4) and the eighth-highest TD-to-INT ratio (2.6). What's at stake: The Packers can clinch the NFC North title with a victory, while the Vikings secured a playoff spot with the Rams' Saturday night loss. If the Vikings win, the NFC North race would move into Week 17. Betting nugget: Since joining Minnesota, Cousins is 13-3 ATS as a single-digit favorite, including 8-1 ATS at home. However, Cousins is 0-8 outright and ATS on Monday Night Football. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Bucs will be without their two Pro Bowl receivers -- Mike Evans and Chris Godwin -- who account for 54% of the team's passing yards. While they've battled hard to win four consecutive games to reach 7-7, none of those victories has come against an opponent with a winning record like the 9-5 Texans. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson is four passing touchdowns away from setting a new single-season franchise record (Matt Schaub had 29 in 2009), and he achieves that on Saturday in Tampa. The Buccaneers are allowing an average of 276.8 passing yards per game, third most in the NFL. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: Bucs QB Jameis Winston has 450-plus passing yards in each of his past two games. The only player in NFL history to record three straight games with at least 400 passing yards is Ryan Fitzpatrick (2018). Betting nugget: Eleven of Tampa Bay's past 12 games have gone over the total. Tampa Bay has won four straight games, going 3-0-1 against the spread (ATS). Read more.",55.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Patriots' top slot cornerback Jonathan Jones (groin) is out, and that is significant. Jones has the lowest completion percentage against him of the 24 corners in the NFL who have faced more than 30 passes in the slot this season. Meanwhile, the Bills have run 3-WR personnel 69% of the time, fourth most in the NFL. Bills slot receiver Cole Beasley could have a big day. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: As if predicting a Bills win at Gillette Stadium isn't bold enough, I'll go a step further. The Patriots have allowed four 100-yard rushers this season: Joe Mixon, Nick Chubb, Mark Ingram II and Buffalo's Frank Gore. They'll allow a fifth on Saturday, when Bills rookie Devin Singletary crosses the century mark. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: According to NFL Next Gen Stats data, Buffalo's Tre'Davious White has allowed just a 47.5% completion percentage as the nearest defender, the fourth lowest among defenders who have been targeted at least 50 times. But New England's Stephon Gilmore actually ranks first (45.2%). Betting nugget: Buffalo is 9-4-1 ATS this season, the best mark in the NFL. The under is 11-3 in Buffalo games, tied with Pittsburgh for the best under record in the league. As for New England, this is the lowest over/under in a Tom Brady start since 2006. Read more.",26.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Rams and Niners are coming off what might be their most disappointing performances of the season. Now they must gather themselves on a short week, with fading playoff hopes on the line for the Rams and a shot at the NFC's top seed and a first-round bye up for grabs for the 49ers. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: The Rams won't be able to slow or stop the run-first 49ers, who will gain 200 rushing yards. The Rams' defense has experienced a meltdown in three games this season, most recently on Sunday in an embarrassing loss to the Cowboys. The 49ers' offense, on the other hand, is rolling and averaging 147 rushing yards per game. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: In the most recent meeting between these teams, in Week 6, Rams quarterback Jared Goff posted a career-worst 0.9 Total QBR. He threw for 78 yards on 28 attempts, and his deepest completion of the game was eight air yards. The Rams' only touchdown drive in that contest was a product of seven straight running plays. Betting nugget: This matches the most points that Los Angeles has been an underdog under Sean McVay, and it also represents the most points L.A. has been an underdog in a game with McVay as coach and Goff starting at quarterback. McVay is 1-4 ATS as an underdog of at least two points. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Ravens will be coming after Baker Mayfield. In Baltimore's Week 4 loss to Cleveland last season, the Ravens blitzed 34% of the time, and Mayfield picked apart the secondary for 342 yards. In the Ravens' Week 16 victory, they ramped up the pressure, sending five or more rushers 56% of the time and limiting Mayfield to 192 yards passing. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Rookie running back J.K. Dobbins scores two touchdowns in his Ravens debut against a short-handed Browns defense down multiple starters due to training camp injuries. Dobbins had eight multi-TD games last season at Ohio State. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: Browns running back Nick Chubb recorded 1,494 rushing yards last season -- second most in the NFL behind Derrick Henry's 1,540 -- and a season-high 165 of them (along with a career-high three rushing touchdowns) came against the Ravens in Week 4. But that isn't the only rushing attack to watch. Baltimore led the NFL with 206.0 rushing yards per game. What to know for fantasy: The Ravens might have spent the 55th overall pick on Dobbins this spring, but Mark Ingram had two of his four best games of last season in the first three weeks and is one of just four players since 2001 to have rushed for six scores in six consecutive seasons (LaDainian Tomlinson, Adrian Peterson and Shaun Alexander). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is 8-1 against the spread (ATS) in his past nine regular-season starts. Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Todd Gurley is expected to play a significant role as the Falcons' new top running back. The team monitored his reps during training camp to make sure his left knee and body are fresh for the regular season. Although Gurley won't be asked to carry the full load, he could bring a much-needed run-game threat to what has been a pass-happy offense. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Seahawks defensive back Marquise Blair will make a game-changing play. He had the best game of his rookie season against the Falcons in Atlanta, with a team-high 11 tackles and a key forced fumble. Blair was one of Seattle's standouts of training camp as he transitioned from safety to nickelback, and he should see action in that role Sunday against the Falcons' three-receiver-heavy offense. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson leads the NFL with 100 passing touchdowns over the past three seasons, but Atlanta's Matt Ryan is 3-2 in his career versus Wilson, including playoffs, and has won the previous two matchups. What to know for fantasy: Ryan has been a top-five fantasy quarterback through the first six weeks in each of the past two seasons and faces a Seahawks defense that allowed the sixth-most passing yards last season (4,223). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Ryan is 12-5 ATS in his career as a home underdog. Read more.",50.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will Minnesota's Dalvin Cook get a contract extension before kickoff? The running back has no leverage to hold out of Sunday's game and risk not accruing a season toward free agency. But who knows how things will play out as Cook's contract status heads into the eleventh hour before game day? -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: The Vikings will sack Aaron Rodgers five times. Minnesota won't have Danielle Hunter, but the Packers will realize they don't have a viable option at right tackle after letting Bryan Bulaga leave in free agency. Rodgers was never sacked more than five times in any game last season. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: Rodgers posted a 50.4 QBR last season, his worst since becoming a starter in 2008. But for the second straight season, he threw for 4,000 yards and fewer than five interceptions -- he is the only QB in NFL history to do it even once. What to know for fantasy: Three of Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen's best seven career games have come against the Packers, and now he is set to see a spike in target share following the trade of Stefon Diggs to Buffalo. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Since hiring coach Mike Zimmer in 2014, Minnesota is 60-34-2 ATS overall (.638), 33-14-1 ATS at home (.702) and 26-11-1 ATS as a home favorite (.703) -- all the best marks in the NFL in that span (regular season). Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This is Stefon Diggs' and Josh Allen's first game together, and it comes against a mediocre Jets secondary. Look for the third-year quarterback to target the Bills' new star wide receiver often as they continue to build chemistry. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: The Jets will score only one touchdown, and it won't happen until late in the game. In his past six games against Sean McDermott-coached defenses, Adam Gase's offenses haven't scored more than 21 points -- and the average per game is just 16.5. The Jets' offense has so many new players that it's hard to imagine an efficient performance. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: Jets quarterback Sam Darnold went 6-2 over the final eight games of the 2019 season, throwing 13 touchdowns and four interceptions. His first five? A 1-4 record, six TDs and nine interceptions. What to know for fantasy: The Bills' Allen has just one touchdown pass in his career against the Jets (78 passes thrown), but he has scored 25.9 fantasy points with his legs in his two full games against the divisional rival. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The underdog has won four of the past five meetings outright in this series. Read more.",39.0,LOW
" What to watch for: While all eyes will be on Cam Newton becoming the first non-homegrown quarterback to start for the Patriots since Scott Secules in Week 10 of the 1993 season, equally as compelling will be the matchup between Dolphins wide receiver DeVante Parker and Patriots cornerback Stephon Gilmore (assuming both play through hamstring injuries). Parker got the better of Gilmore -- the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year -- in last year's season finale (eight catches, 137 yards) in a performance that sat with Gilmore all offseason. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: Preston Williams -- not Parker -- leads the Dolphins in receiving, totaling over 100 yards in his first game back from a torn ACL. Parker was the star of the previous matchup between these two teams. But with a healthy duo and extra attention on Parker, Williams will be the main beneficiary of Ryan Fitzpatrick's aggressive downfield throws. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: Newton will become fifth quarterback to make his first start for the Patriots since Bill Belichick became the team's head coach. The previous four all won that first start. What to know for fantasy: After getting shut out in Week 2 against the Patriots, Parker's 137 receiving yards in Week 17 were the most against New England since Tyreek Hill's 142 in Week 6 of 2018. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami was 9-3 ATS over the final 12 games last season, all as an underdog. Read more.",40.0,LOW
" What to watch for: There are two key matchups. First, keep an eye on Washington's defensive front, the strength of the team, versus the Eagles' offensive line, which has been weakened. The second is Washington wide receiver Terry McLaurin against Philly cornerback Darius Slay. McLaurin caught five passes for 72 yards in a matchup versus Slay last season when the latter played for Detroit. In two games against the Eagles, McLaurin caught a combined 10 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Chase Young will begin his NFL career with a pair of sacks. The Eagles' offensive line had a rough summer, losing a pair of starters, Brandon Brooks and Andre Dillard, to to injury, and a third, Lane Johnson, was hobbled for much of camp with an ailing ankle. Jason Peters, 38, moved back out to left tackle this week after training this offseason at guard and will have to quickly adjust to fend off Young and the rest of Washington's formidable pass-rushers. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: In seven career starts against Washington, Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz has a 5-2 record with 15 passing touchdowns. What to know for fantasy: The Eagles ended the 2019 regular season on a four-game win streak and led the league in running back fantasy points over that stretch (163). That run included a game at Washington (Week 15) in which Miles Sanders scored a season-high 35.2 points. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Eagles have won the past six games in this series, covering in five of them. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Bears starter Mitchell Trubisky has shredded the Lions' defense over the past two seasons, throwing nine touchdowns and one interception. Detroit has the same head coach (Matt Patricia) but a new defensive coordinator (Cory Undlin). Whether Trubisky continues to complete passes at a 74.7% clip against Detroit will be the difference. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Chicago's offense scores a touchdown on its opening drive. Unlikely, right? The Bears' offense struggled horribly in the first quarter last season. In their first eight games of 2019, the Bears scored one touchdown and punted an NFL-worst seven times on opening drives, and they ended the season with 37 first-quarter points. Will the Bears' offense rise from the ashes with Trubisky back at quarterback? Well, probably not. But he is usually pretty good versus the Lions. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: The 2019 Bears offense ranked No. 31 in yards per play (4.7), No. 29 in points per game (17.5) and No. 27 in offensive efficiency (35.4). In all, it had nine games with fewer than 20 points last season, tied for fourth most in the NFL. Part of the reason was Trubisky's drop in Total QBR from 2018, a plummet that ranked second worst behind only his new backup, Nick Foles (minimum 100 pass attempts). What to know for fantasy: Chicago wide receiver Allen Robinson scored 104.9 fantasy points in divisional games last season, ranking him fourth at the position (behind only Michael Thomas, Chris Godwin and Robert Woods). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Detroit has nine consecutive seasons of hitting the over in its season opener, the longest active streak in the league. And the Bears were 1-7 ATS on the road last season and failed to cover in 10 of the past 12 games overall. Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Carolina ranked as one of the worst teams in the NFL at stopping the run last season, allowing 143.5 yards per game, and the Raiders ranked 13th in rushing offense with 118.3 yards per game. So keep an eye on how the addition of first-round pick Derrick Brown, a defensive tackle out of Auburn, and the return of Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short from injured reserve bolsters a run defense that new Panthers coach Matt Rhule says will be key. -- David Newton Bold prediction: A high-scoring, college football-style shootout is in the offing. Didn't Rhule and offensive coordinator Joe Brady just coach in college? ""We've been watching Baylor, we've been watching Temple, we've been watching LSU's offense, we've been watching the Saints' offense,"" Raiders coach Jon Gruden said, ""to get ready for the Carolina offense."" With Christian McCaffrey and Derek Carr, I'm calling for a bunch of points. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: The Panthers have just 46% of last season's snaps returning in 2020, the fewest in the NFL. And that includes 34% of their defensive snaps, the fewest in the NFL by 15%. The Raiders are second lowest in that department at 49%. What to know for fantasy: Carolina's DJ Moore quietly tied for the third-most games as a top-20 performer at wide receiver (nine), and over the past two seasons, the Raiders have allowed the seventh-most points to opposing receivers. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: New Panthers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is 16-2 ATS as an underdog, the best record in the Super Bowl era (minimum 15 starts). Read more.",63.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Jaguars have always had trouble with Philip Rivers. The quarterback is 7-2 against them -- completing 69.4% of his passes for 2,668 yards and 24 touchdowns with only five interceptions -- and he has led his team to at least 31 points in six of the seven victories. Rivers is 38 and has slowed a bit, but he'll be facing a young, unproven Jaguars defense. The Jags have one rookie cornerback (CJ Henderson) starting, and five of the team's 11 defensive backs are rookies. The only proven pass-rusher on the roster is Josh Allen, and the interior of the defensive line has been ravaged by injuries and retirements. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: The Colts will have more than 175 yards rushing. The Jaguars are in rebuild mode, and the Colts are coming off a 2019 season in which they were seventh in the NFL in rushing. So what better way to show that their success isn't predicated on Rivers' right arm than by having running backs Marlon Mack and rookie Jonathan Taylor rushing behind one of the league's best offensive lines, led by All-Pro guard Quenton Nelson? -- Mike Wells Stat to know: The Jaguars have won five consecutive home games against the Colts after going 4-10 in their first 14 home games versus Indianapolis in franchise history. The Colts have lost six straight season openers, tied with the Bears for the longest active streak in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Over the past five seasons, Rivers averages 21 fantasy points in Week 1 and 16.4 in all other games. He faces a Jags team that allowed the sixth-most yards per pass attempt last season (7.9) and allowed the fifth-most big pass plays (30-plus yards gained). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Colts are the fifth team since 1970 to be favored by a TD or more in Week 1 after missing the playoffs the season before. The other four teams went 0-4 ATS. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: All eyes will be on Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, who will be starting in his NFL debut. He'll have to contend with Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa, Burrow's former teammate at Ohio State, and a stout Chargers defense. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: The Chargers' defense will pick off Burrow at least two times. The Chargers' secondary might be down star safety Derwin James for the season, but watch for their defensive backs, led by Chris Harris Jr. and Casey Hayward Jr., to take advantage of the rookie. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: The Bengals went 2-14 last season in their first year under coach Zac Taylor, tied for the worst record in team history. But Burrow hasn't lost a game since Nov. 24, 2018. On the other side of the field, Tyrod Taylor isn't debuting, but he will be the first QB not named Philip Rivers to start a game for the Chargers since the 2005 season finale, when Drew Brees started for San Diego. Taylor most recently started in 2018, when he was under center for three games with the Browns (1-1-1). What to know for fantasy: Only three times did a quarterback score more than 16.5 fantasy points against the Chargers last season, so while Burrow deserves the hype, counting on him breaking Cam Newton's record for QB points in a debut (30.7 in 2011) isn't wise. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Chargers have covered the spread in each of their past five season openers. Read more.",36.0,LOW
" What to watch for: It's a matchup for the ages: Tom Brady against Drew Brees. This will be the first game in NFL history with two starting QBs over 40 years old, and both teams are decidedly ""Super Bowl or bust"" because of it. Brees has not officially declared this as his final NFL season but acknowledged this week, ""I'm on borrowed time. I've got nothing to lose, so I'm turning it loose."" -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: Brady and Brees will combine for 600-plus passing yards and five touchdowns, as both continue to defy Father Time. Perhaps this is a sneak peek at the NFC Championship Game. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski has caught 78 touchdown passes from Brady, the fifth most by any quarterback-receiver combo in NFL history and just two shy of passing Dan Marino and Mark Clayton for fourth on the list. What to know for fantasy: Brees' past two home games against the Bucs have resulted in 50.3 fantasy points, an 81.9% completion percentage, five touchdown tosses and zero interceptions. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Brady is an underdog for the first time in his past 75 regular-season games, ending the longest active streak of being favored. Read more.",50.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Have the Niners put their Super Bowl disappointment behind them? Is Arizona ready to take the next step to contend after some big offseason additions? These teams played a pair of thrillers last season, with the 49ers winning both by a combined 13 points. If this one looks similar, it could portend a season full of heavyweight brawls in the loaded NFC West. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: DeAndre Hopkins' Cardinals debut will be one to remember. The newest member of the Arizona receiving corps will have 150 yards and two touchdowns from quarterback Kyler Murray, showing how far they've come together in a short amount of time and issuing a preview of what's still ahead. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: The Cardinals were 1-5 in division games last season, their worst record since 2012, and they lost both of their games against the 49ers. But Arizona hasn't lost three straight to San Francisco since 2012-13. Murray, who in 2019 became the sixth QB with 3,500 passing yards and 500 rushing yards in single season, will have to have a big game to avoid three in a row. What to know for fantasy: Two of Murray's top five games came against the 49ers last season, and that was without a pass-catcher (WR/TE) scoring 16 points in either of those games. Hopkins, though, has 16.5 fantasy points per game for his career and 19.8 over the past three seasons. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Cardinals are 4-0-1 ATS in their past five against the Niners, whereas the Niners are 3-15-2 ATS in their past 20 games as the home favorite. Read more.",58.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Rams' defense returns stars Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey, but under first-year coordinator Brandon Staley, the unit will face a tall challenge in stopping Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott and the top-rated 2019 Cowboys offense directed by second-year coordinator Kellen Moore. Staley, whose defense is expected to emulate the Bears' and Broncos', must find a way to keep the Cowboys from gaining the 263 rushing yards they piled on the Rams late last season. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Prescott will see a pass intercepted. Not bold? In four season openers, he has thrown 131 passes without having a pass picked off. To close last season, Prescott did not have an interception in the final four games. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: Last season, Prescott became the fifth player in NFL history to pass for 400 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions in an opener. And after compiling 4,902 pass yards in 2019 -- the second most in franchise history -- he could join Tony Romo as only Cowboys QBs with consecutive seasons of 4,000-plus passing yards. What to know for fantasy: The Rams held wide receiver Michael Gallup to a season-low six yards in Week 15 last season, but he caught 10 passes for 196 yards and three scores over the final two weeks of 2019 and saw his ADP rise throughout draft season this summer. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Rams are 1-8-1 in their past 10 games as a home underdog. Read more.",56.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It's Ben Roethlisberger's first game back from an elbow injury that required surgery. Without a preseason this year, he hasn't played in a game since Week 2 of last season. Will Roethlisberger instantly be back to his previous form? It might not be so easy for the 38-year-old. All eyes will be on the future Hall of Fame quarterback against a Giants defense that has some deficiencies on the back end. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Pittsburgh running back James Conner rushes for over 100 yards against a leaky Giants front. The running back is entering a contract year coming off an injury-plagued season. Fully healthy, he's going to capitalize on the chance to be the Steelers' main tailback and run all over the Giants. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: Daniel Jones will be the first Giants QB not named Eli Manning to start a season opener since Kurt Warner in 2004, as well as the second-youngest Giants quarterback (23) to start the opener in the Super Bowl era (Jerry Golsteyn, 1977). Jones had 20 touchdowns and three interceptions versus man coverage last season, but four touchdowns and nine interceptions against zone, per ESPN metrics powered by NFL Next Gen Stats. The Steelers' defense led the NFL in Total QBR (24) and interceptions (14) when playing zone coverage. What to know for fantasy: No better time to be healthy than Week 1, and in eight career games with 20-plus touches, Conner averages 29.3 fantasy points per game (10 TDs in those games). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Steelers are 16-2 outright and 10-8 ATS on Monday night under coach Mike Tomlin. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How will the Broncos' youthful offense, with Drew Lock starting his first season opener at quarterback, respond to the moment? The Broncos' plan to lean on the defense early in the season took an immense hit Tuesday when Von Miller suffered what might be a season-ending ankle injury on the final play of practice. But they stumbled out of the gate 0-4 last season largely because of an offense that couldn't get out of neutral. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Ryan Tannehill and the Titans' passing game will come out firing away against a Broncos defense that will stack the box to stop running back Derrick Henry. As a result, both A.J. Brown and Corey Davis will finish with 100-plus yards receiving. Why is that bold? The most recent Titans duo to finish with 100 yards receiving each was Justin Hunter (109) and Kendall Wright (103) in a 23-19 win over the Raiders on Nov. 24, 2013. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Titans were 9-4 with Tannehill starting at QB last season (including the playoffs) after beginning the season 2-4 under Marcus Mariota. And the Broncos were 4-1 with Lock as their starting QB versus 3-8 with everyone else. Lock will become the second-youngest Broncos QB (23) to start the season opener in the Super Bowl era (John Elway). What to know for fantasy: The Broncos were the seventh-best defense in terms of preventing yards after contact during the second half of last season. Those gains will need to be sustained as they face Henry, the fifth-highest-scoring RB in 2019 and the leader (minimum 500 carries) in yards after contact since he entered the league in 2016. But note that Henry had season lows in rushes (15), rushing yards (28) and rushing yards after contact (23) in Week 6 at the Broncos last season. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Titans are 6-2 straight up and 7-1 ATS in their past eight Monday night games. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald has zero sacks and just one tackle for loss in three career games against Philadelphia. He has a favorable matchup in this one, however, with inexperienced second-year player Nate Herbig projected to start at right guard. Center Jason Kelce will need to chip in on double-teams to prevent Carson Wentz, who was sacked a league-high eight times in Week 1, from having another rough day. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Donald will have a monster multisack game to that end. In a season-opening win over Dallas, Donald knocked down Cowboys linemen as if they were bowling pins and recorded his first sack of the season. Now watch for the two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year to take advantage of an inexperienced Eagles guard and make it another long day for Wentz. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: This marks the second career meeting between the top two picks of the 2016 NFL draft, Wentz and Jared Goff. Wentz won the first in 2017 with four passing touchdowns. But both enter off underwhelming Week 1 performances. Goff threw zero touchdowns for the fourth time in his past nine games, while Wentz took those eight sacks. What to know for fantasy: Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert has 6.1 more fantasy points over his past five games than Zach Ertz does. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Philadelphia is 5-0-1 against the spread (ATS) against the Rams since 2006. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: When these teams met in 2018, running back Ezekiel Elliott had 201 scrimmage yards in the Cowboys' win. Elliott had 122 yards on the ground and another 79 as a pass-catcher. Seattle's Russell Wilson threw four touchdown passes against the Falcons last week, so you should see some course correction in turns of pass defense, which means Elliott is in for a big day. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Falcons running back Todd Gurley will have his first 100-yard rushing game with Atlanta. He hasn't hit the century mark since Week 13 of the 2018 season, but Gurley does have two 100-yard games in three career meetings with the Cowboys, and the Falcons need to stick with the run. -- Vaughn McClure Stat to know: Since 2011, only four teams haven't started a season 0-2: the Cowboys (last started 0-2 in 2010), Falcons (2007), Packers (2006) and Patriots (2001). Both Atlanta and Dallas sit at 0-1 entering this matchup. What to know for fantasy: The longest active streak of games with 75-plus receiving yards belongs to Calvin Ridley (five straight). Julio Jones and Davante Adams are chasing him, as they each have four straight. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta is 4-0 ATS in its past four road games. Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Steelers shut down one of the league's premier running backs Monday night, allowing Saquon Barkley only 6 rushing yards. The Broncos' rushers fared a bit better against the Titans, averaging 4.1 yards per carry, but they enter Sunday's matchup with a question about Phillip Lindsay's availability. Look for the Steelers' defense to dominate yet another ground game. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: The Broncos will sack Ben Roethlisberger at least four times and force at least one turnover on a QB hit. Yes, Von Miller is out for the year, Bradley Chubb is still working his way back from last season's ACL surgery and the Broncos were tepid in the pass rush in much of their Week 1 loss to the Titans. But Roethlisberger has faced the Broncos nine times in his long career, and the Broncos have sacked him at least three times in seven of those games -- and at least four times in four of them. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: The Steelers have gone 58 straight games with at least one sack, tied for the sixth-longest streak by any team since 1970. A sack in this one would put them in a tie for the fifth-longest streak. What to know for fantasy: Roethlisberger (22.1 points) was better in Week 1 than the healthy version of him we saw in 2018 (21.4 points per game), as he threw three touchdown passes on just 32 attempts. He had zero TD passes on 62 attempts before his season ended in 2019. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Broncos have failed to cover their past four games off less than a full week of rest. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: It's a battle of two relatively inexperienced quarterbacks -- the 49ers' Jimmy Garoppolo and the Jets' Sam Darnold (27 career starts each). Garoppolo (21-6) has done more winning than Darnold (11-16), who hasn't had the same talent and coaching around him as his counterpart. How each performs on Sunday will be a difference-maker for two passing offenses looking to get going after Week 1 losses. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: Niners rookie receiver Brandon Aiyuk will go over 100 yards in his NFL debut. Aiyuk is back from a hamstring injury, and after a poor showing for the Niners' receivers last week, he will get plenty of chances to show why coach Kyle Shanahan coveted him in the first round of the NFL draft. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: San Francisco tight end George Kittle was held to 44 receiving yards on four catches in Week 1. He hasn't had back-to-back games under 50 yards since 2017. What to know for fantasy: No player in the NFL accounted for a greater percentage of his team's Week 1 scrimmage yards than Jamison Crowder (45.3%). Whether he suits up will be something to keep an eye on. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is 7-21-2 ATS in its past 30 games as a favorite. But in its past 20 games as a road favorite, San Francisco is 13-7 ATS. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Colts cornerback Xavier Rhodes faces his former team; the Vikings released him in the offseason after seven seasons with the franchise. Rhodes' debut with the Colts didn't go too well in Week 1 against Jacksonville. He gave up a 22-yard touchdown when he was caught peeking in the backfield, expecting a run. Then he was flagged for 30-yard pass interference, which ended up leading to a field goal for the Jaguars. Can he improve while trying to contain Minnesota's passing attack? -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Vikings receiver Adam Thielen will haul in seven catches for 120-plus yards. It'll be his second straight week crossing the century mark, putting him on his way to matching the historic streak he set in 2018 when he started the season with eight straight 100-yard receiving performances. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Colts quarterback Philip Rivers has four passing touchdowns, seven interceptions and a 1-3 record in four career starts against the Vikings. His 35.1 Total QBR against them is his worst against any team since the metric was first tracked in 2006. What to know for fantasy: Indianapolis receiver Parris Campbell not only set career highs in routes (38), targets (9), catches (6), yards (71) and fantasy points (14) in Week 1, but he also led the team in deep targets (3). See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Vikings have covered their past five games after a loss. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can Packers receiver Davante Adams have another big day after his career-high 14-catch performance in Week 1 against the Vikings? Well, the Lions' secondary is banged up, and Adams is a tough cover. He had at least one catch on nine different route types last week, according to ESPN Stats & Information research using NFL Next Gen Stats. The Lions played man coverage on 82% of their defense snaps in Week 1, the highest rate of any team on opening weekend. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers throws four more touchdowns this week against Detroit. Rodgers has had just intermittent success against Matt Patricia's Lions, but this is a different Detroit secondary. Its corners are banged up -- Desmond Trufant and Darryl Roberts both missed practices this week -- and rookie Jeff Okudah might be making his debut. Depending how the Lions match up, that debut could come against Adams. So watch for Rodgers to slice through a depleted Lions secondary. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Per the Elias Sports Bureau, only two teams have gone 2-0 against an opponent in a season without ever holding a lead in regulation. The first was the 1977 49ers, who bested the Saints twice. The second was the 2019 Packers, who won both of their games against Detroit last season on game-ending field goals despite not holding a lead at any point in either game. What to know for fantasy: Adams was the top scoring player in Week 1 (41.6 points) and has caught six touchdown passes over his past six matchups with the Lions. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Lions have covered in six straight games against the Packers. Read more.",57.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Bucs fell short in their quest to go toe-to-toe with the Saints last week, but since his first career start in 2001, Tom Brady has a career 48-13 record coming off a loss (.787 win percentage), second only to that of Russell Wilson. Panthers coach Matt Rhule said it himself: ""No one's better at bouncing back from a loss than Tom Brady."" But what about Mike Evans? Can he rebound from his one-catch performance? And how quickly can a Panthers defense that started four rookies last Sunday make progress in Week 2? -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: The Panthers will sack Brady at least five times and pull off an upset. They were one of three teams that did not get a sack in their opener and the only team that didn't contact the quarterback while running or throwing. Rhule says he wants them to get more violent at the point of attack. -- David Newton Stat to know: Both of Brady's interceptions last week came when throwing within 2.5 seconds of the snap, per NFL Next Gen Stats. He had three such picks in all of 2019. What to know for fantasy: The Bucs held Christian McCaffrey to 7.3 points in Week 2 last season. Since then, he has joined Emmitt Smith (23), Marcus Allen (17) and Todd Gurley (15) as the only running backs to score at least 15 fantasy points in 15 straight games. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Carolina quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is 10-0 ATS as an underdog of 3.5-plus points. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: In two games against the Dolphins in 2019, Bills quarterback Josh Allen completed 62.7% of his passes for 458 yards, five touchdowns and zero interceptions, along with 11 rushes for 88 yards and a touchdown. We should keep an eye on whether that success continues against a revamped Dolphins defense which now includes former Bills edge rusher Shaq Lawson but still gave up 217 rushing yards last week to the Patriots -- including 75 yards to Cam Newton. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: The Bills will have two 100-yard receivers on Sunday. They ran a four-receiver set on a league-high 25% of their snaps last week, and despite the Dolphins' struggles against the run in Week 1, the Bills will commit once again to their passing game. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: The Dolphins had 87 rushing yards in Week 1, and they had 13 games with fewer than 100 rushing yards last season (tied for the most in the NFL with the Jets). What to know for fantasy: Allen has thrown multiple touchdown tosses nine times in his career, and he is 4-for-4 against the Dolphins and 5-for-25 against the rest of the NFL. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Bills have covered four straight games as the favorite. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Titans running back Derrick Henry has tormented the Jaguars to the tune of 498 rushing yards in his past four games against them. Jacksonville added middle linebacker Joe Schobert in the offseason, allowing Myles Jack to move to his more natural weakside linebacker spot. Pay attention to how the Titans find ways to get Henry to the second level of the defense, and how Jacksonville's linebackers attempt to prevent explosive plays. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Henry doesn't hit 100 yards rushing. He has rushed for 238 yards and 159 yards in the past two meetings in Nashville, and he has seven 100-plus-yard rushing games since the start of the 2019 season (tied for the most), but the Jaguars' run defense did a good job against the Colts for the final 2½ quarters last Sunday, and rookie defensive tackle DaVon Hamilton played well in his debut. The Jaguars are making Henry their top priority -- they might get hurt by the pass game, but they're not going to let Henry beat them again. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Jaguars quarterback Gardner Minshew has three passing touchdowns in consecutive games dating to last year, and no QB in Jaguars history has thrown at least three in three consecutive games. What to know for fantasy: Henry has seven rushing scores over his past three games against the Jags, and the Titans sure weren't shy about handing him the rock in Week 1 (31 carries, the only player in the NFL with more than 25). See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Titans have covered five of their past six against the Jaguars. Read more.",33.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The focus is squarely on Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. The embattled former second overall pick led Chicago to a memorable fourth-quarter comeback in Week 1, but not even Trubisky's three touchdown passes in the final 15 minutes could cover up for how inconsistent he played in the opening three quarters at Ford Field. Head coach Matt Nagy wants even play from the 25-year-old quarterback. The Giants might present Trubisky with an opportunity to have a more balanced performance on Sunday. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Bears wide receiver Allen Robinson tops 150 yards receiving. Robinson is not happy with his contract, and what better way to prove he deserves to get paid than to play against the Giants' defense? Robinson's best game last year came against the Giants, when he had 131 yards receiving and a touchdown. The Bears put him in the slot throughout that game and let him eat. The Giants apparently haven't fixed that problem. JuJu Smith-Schuster caught six passes on six targets for 69 yards and two touchdowns out of the slot against this Giants on Monday night. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: Giants running back Saquon Barkley had just 6 rushing yards in Week 1 and averaged minus-0.2 yards before contact per rush. His 3.96 yards per rush since Week 7 of last season is the 10th-lowest average in the NFL among 32 players with at least 100 rushes in that span. What to know for fantasy: New York quarterback Daniel Jones has run for at least 20 yards in five of his past seven games and thrown at least 40 passes in seven of his past nine. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Chicago is 1-6 ATS in its past seven games as a favorite. Read more.",41.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The matchup to watch will be Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray vs. Washington edge rusher Chase Young. It's a showdown between two of the best young players in the NFL, last year's No. 1 pick and this year's No. 2 pick. In their respective openers, Murray ran for 91 yards, and Young had 1.5 sacks. While this matchup won't determine the game, it'll definitely have an impact and will be fun to watch. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Washington will hold Murray to 50 yards rushing, and Young will sack him twice. Young can be moved around but had his best success as a right end against Jason Peters last week. He'll also be used on some stunts inside, and that's where he'll get Murray. But Murray will still throw for 225 yards in a win. -- John Keim Stat to know: Washington quarterback Dwayne Haskins had an off-target percentage of 30% in Week 1, which ranked No. 31 out of 32 qualified quarterbacks. What to know for fantasy: Washington posted a sack on 16% of Philadelphia dropbacks last week, the highest rate in the league and better than any performance it had last season. And since the beginning of last season, Murray ranks 27th in completion percentage when under pressure (37.7%). See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The total has gone under in nine of Arizona's past 11 September games. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Will Lamar Jackson and Deshaun Watson continue to have success on the run? Both rushed for seven touchdowns in 2019, but they also each scored eight touchdowns (with no interceptions) when passing on the run, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. Only then-Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston threw more touchdowns on the run last season. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: Baltimore's Jackson will rush for at least 100 yards. He showed in Week 1 that he has made great strides as a passer, but let's not forget he's among the league's most dangerous playmakers when scrambling. The Texans have allowed quarterbacks to average 5.6 yards per rush since the start of 2019, which is the second-worst average over that span. Last season, Jackson ran for 79 yards against Houston, including a 39-yard run (which was his second longest of the season). -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: Per the Elias Sports Bureau, the 2020 Texans are the second team in NFL history to face the reigning MVP and Super Bowl MVP in each of their first two games of a season (they faced Patrick Mahomes in Week 1). The 2004 Colts are the other, as they faced Tom Brady (Super Bowl MVP) and Steve McNair (MVP) to open their year. They started 1-1 and finished 12-4. What to know for fantasy: 250 passing yards, 25 rushing yards, a passing touchdown and a rushing touchdown. Watson led the NFL with two such games in 2018, led again in 2019 with three such games and was one of two quarterbacks (Josh Allen) to accomplish the feat in Week 1 this season. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Ravens have covered in five straight regular-season games, and 10 of their past 11. Read more.",57.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Keep an eye on the turnover margin. In losing five of six games to the Chiefs since Anthony Lynn took over as head coach, the Chargers' offense has committed 17 turnovers, and their defense has generated only two of them. ""That's ridiculous,"" Lynn said. ""You're just not going to beat this team that way."" -- Alden Gonzalez Bold prediction: The Chiefs, who intercepted 15 passes in their past six games against the Chargers, will get a couple of picks against Tyrod Taylor. The Chiefs got consistent pressure on the Texans' Deshaun Watson last week, and look for them to have similar success against Taylor, who isn't as prone to throwing interceptions as ex-Chargers QB Philip Rivers but will be forced into mistakes on Sunday. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is 8-0 with an 89 Total QBR and 26 passing touchdowns in the month of September, all the best in the NFL since the start of the 2018 season. The Chiefs have won 10 straight games overall (including playoffs), the second-longest streak in franchise history (11 straight in 2015 season). What to know for fantasy: Chargers running back Austin Ekeler has converted just 15.4% of his career red zone carries (the RB average is 18%), so it's worth noting that rookie Joshua Kelley had more touches in the red zone in Week 1. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Chiefs have covered in their past seven divisional games. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will the Seahawks continue to let Russell Wilson cook? They strayed from their usual establish-the-run M.O. and dropped back to pass on 11 of their 14 first-quarter offensive plays against Atlanta. Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer has said matchups will factor into how much the Seahawks throw early, and the matchup this week includes the league's reigning Defensive Player of the Year, cornerback Stephon Gilmore. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Undrafted rookie running back J.J. Taylor will make a play that leads the national television audience to take notice. At 5-foot-8 and 185 pounds, he can play ""hide and seek,"" according to running backs coach Ivan Fears, who has compared Taylor to Dion Lewis and Darren Sproles in terms of his physical stature. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: Cam Newton and Wilson have combined for five seasons with at least 3,500 passing yards and 500 rushing yards. The rest of the players in NFL history have combined for four such seasons. What to know for fantasy: Newton was the sixth-highest-scoring quarterback in Week 1, and his 25.7 points were more than Tom Brady had in any single game from last season. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: This ends the Patriots' streak of being favored in 64 consecutive games. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Las Vegas is breaking in a new stadium in the most bittersweet of circumstances. With no fans, there is not much of a home-field advantage to help cover up the Raiders' injury woes at right tackle, where Trent Brown left the opener with a right calf issue and his replacement, Sam Young, suffered a groin injury. Keep an eye, then, on the Raiders' willingness to run the ball if they fall behind early. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: Raiders running back Josh Jacobs will end the Saints' remarkable streak of 44 straight games, including the playoffs, without allowing a 100-yard rusher. But Saints running back Alvin Kamara will have more than 100 receiving yards to fill the void if Michael Thomas (ankle) is out or limited. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Las Vegas quarterback Derek Carr is completing 71% of his passes since the start of last season, second-best in the NFL to ... Saints QB Drew Brees (73%). Carr has thrown at least one passing touchdown with zero interceptions in five straight games, the second-longest active streak in the NFL and tied for the longest streak of his career. What to know for fantasy: Saints wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders led the league with four red zone targets in Week 1 and figures to stay busy with Thomas' role now potentially up for grabs -- if he is healthy enough to play himself. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Brees is 9-2 ATS against the Raiders in his career. Read more.",52.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Bills quarterback Josh Allen leads the NFL in scramble yards since entering the league in 2018, but Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald ranks second in the league in sacks since 2014. It's unstoppable force meets immovable object, and something's got to give. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Rams running back Darrell Henderson Jr. rushes for 100-plus yards. Yes, the Bills rank third in the NFL in rushing defense, allowing an average of 75.5 rushing yards per game, but Henderson gained 121 all-purpose yards in a Week 2 win, and he says he wasn't even 100 percent with a lingering hamstring injury. Watch for him to find another gear in a breakout performance. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Stefon Diggs has 239 receiving yards this season, tied for the most in the NFL. The most receiving yards through the first three games of a season in Bills history is 352, by Peerless Price in 2002. What to know for fantasy: Two of Allen's top five fantasy games of his career have come this season, and he's averaging 65% more points per pass attempt than he did last season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The Rams are 13-5 against the spread (ATS) since the start of last season (2-0 this season). Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How the Patriots plan to cover Raiders tight end Darren Waller (18 receptions) is the game within the game. In Week 1, second-year defensive back Joejuan Williams was primarily assigned to cover Dolphins tight end Mike Gesicki, but that's because the Patriots viewed Gesicki as more of a wide receiver. Waller has a more complete skill set that makes him a true tight end, and the Raiders move him around a lot, even putting him in the backfield at times. So finding and locating Waller is the first challenge. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: Patriots quarterback Cam Newton will rush for at least two touchdowns. At an athletic 6-foot-5, 245 pounds, he is bigger than any linebacker or defensive back the Raiders have on their active roster. So you know Newton, called a ""power forward"" by Raiders coach Jon Gruden, is champing at the bit to run the read-option. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: The Raiders have the second-highest offensive efficiency rating (90.6) in the NFL through Week 2 (Packers, 94.0). They have scored 30-plus points in their first two games but have not done so in three straight games since 2016 (Weeks 7-9), the last season they made the playoffs. What to know for fantasy: Waller saw a career-high 16 targets in Week 2, and his 24 targets through two weeks are the third most in the NFL. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: New England is 51-26 ATS after a loss in the Bill Belichick era, including 40-15 ATS since 2003. Read more.",58.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will the Vikings' offense be able to keep up with Tennessee's scoring pace? Minnesota's defense has struggled to get its opponents off the field, and the lack of opportunities for its offensive playmakers not named Adam Thielen has been noticeable. Is this the week when the offense leans heavily on running back Dalvin Cook, and can quarterback Kirk Cousins finally involve rookie receiver Justin Jefferson and/or tight end Irv Smith Jr.? -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Titans QB Ryan Tannehill will finish with 300-plus passing yards. That might not seem bold, but here's something to consider: Tannehill has finished with 300 or more passing yards only three times since taking over in Week 7 last season. Defenses are focused on stopping Derrick Henry, which presents one-on-one matchups for the receivers. Tannehill and the passing game should have the advantage against a depleted Vikings secondary in those situations. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Titans are seeking their first 3-0 start since 2008 (started 10-0 and finished 13-3), and the Vikings are trying to avoid their first 0-3 start since 2013 (the last Vikings team to lose 10-plus games). What to know for fantasy: Since 2018, Henry is averaging 54.4% more points per game when his team is favored than when it is the underdog. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota is 7-3 ATS as a home underdog under Mike Zimmer, including the playoffs. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Steelers have blitzed 64% of the time this season, the most in the NFL by a wide margin, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. And Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson has the second-worst Total QBR against the blitz. Though Watson is the best signal-caller the Steelers have faced this season, look for the defense to still get a ton of pressure on the quarterback -- and from everywhere on the field. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: J.J. Watt and T.J. Watt will combine for five sacks. The Watt brothers usually have to check their phones after playing in a game to see how the other pass-rusher did, but on Sunday, they'll get to play in front of each other. In Week 2, the Watts combined for 4.5 sacks, which was the second most by a set of brothers in a single day in NFL history. They'll top that on Sunday. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: The Steelers have started 2-0 for the seventh time in the Ben Roethlisberger era (since 2004). They went on to make the playoffs in each of the past six instances (2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2016 and 2017). The Texans, on the other hand, are off to an 0-2 start for the third time in the past six seasons (2015 and 2018). But they recovered to make the playoffs in each of the previous two instances. What to know for fantasy: Pittsburgh running back James Conner sure looked healthy in Week 2, as he piled up 97.2% of the Steelers' rushing yards. He was the only running back with a rate north of 85% last week. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Pittsburgh is 7-13-2 ATS as a favorite since 2018. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Who is playing -- and where -- for each team? The 49ers are without their top two running backs, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, Defensive Rookie of the Year Nick Bosa and several others. The Giants are missing Saquon Barkley and Sterling Shepard. Who takes their spots? And can they be capable fill-ins? Start with 49ers backup quarterback Nick Mullens and newly signed Giants running back Devonta Freeman. All eyes will be on those two. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: 49ers running back Jerick McKinnon will have his first 100-plus-yard rushing game since 2014 and just the third in his career. With Raheem Mostert and Tevin Coleman out because of knee sprains, McKinnon will have an expanded role this week, and he gets it against a Giants defense that has been shoddy against the run over the first two weeks and hasn't seen a rushing attack as dangerous as the Niners' unit yet. McKinnon will take advantage and reach the end zone for the third time in as many weeks. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: Giants quarterback Daniel Jones has nine games with at least two turnovers since 2019, tied with Jameis Winston for the most in the NFL in that span -- and that includes three straight dating back to last season. What to know for fantasy: It's been over 1,000 days since McKinnon (roughly 80% available) has had 15 carries in a game, but with Mostert and Coleman out, the path to volume has been paved. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Since 2017, the Giants are 2-14 ATS as a home underdog of less than seven points. Read more.",39.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Falcons are 0-2 in a must-win season for coach Dan Quinn, and a home loss to a subpar Bears team would make Quinn's hot seat even hotter. The Falcons have to stick to the formula of balance on offense and creating turnovers on defense. A rash of injuries to players such as Julio Jones and Dante Fowler Jr. might be their big obstacle this week, but the game is too critical to use injuries as a crutch. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Bears running back David Montgomery rushes for 100-plus yards for just the third time in his NFL career. Chicago had one of the worst rushing attacks in 2019, but head coach Matt Nagy entered the season with a renewed determination to run the football. Montgomery gained 82 yards on the ground in 16 carries versus the Giants last Sunday. The former third-round pick, who dealt with a groin injury over the summer, is on the verge of having a breakout performance. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: After catching a pair in each of Atlanta's first two games of the season, Falcons receiver Calvin Ridley now has 21 career receiving touchdowns, the second most by a Falcons player over his first three seasons (Andre Rison, 22). What to know for fantasy: The Falcons have allowed the top-scoring fantasy QB in each of the first two weeks, and Mitchell Trubisky does have the third-best fantasy quarter by a QB this season (Week 1, fourth quarter).

" What to watch for: Can Browns QB Baker Mayfield and receiver Odell Beckham Jr. build off their breakout performance in Week 2? They finally connected on several big plays together, including a 43-yard touchdown. Before that, OBJ had only had four TD grabs since being traded to Cleveland last spring. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: Beckham will have his first 100-yard receiving day since Oct. 13 last season. He had 74 yards last week and is now facing a secondary that has allowed too many players to get behind it. Washington will be so focused on stopping running backs Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt that Beckham will benefit off play-action. Beckham has two catches for 59 yards off play-action this season; he'll add to that total. -- John Keim Stat to know: Washington leads the NFL with 11 sacks over its first two games. And 13.8% of opponent pass attempts have resulted in sacks, the second-highest rate in the NFL behind Indianapolis (15.2%). What to know for fantasy: Half of Beckham's points this season have come on a single catch, but that could work out, as only two teams have allowed more 25-plus-yard receptions than Washington this season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The Browns have failed to cover in their past five games, dating back to last season. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: This game will be decided on whether the Eagles can generate a pass-rush. Bengals rookie QB Joe Burrow has been sacked six times this season, tied for the fifth most in the NFL, while the Eagles' defense ranks toward the bottom of the league with four sacks generated. With defensive tackle Fletcher Cox (oblique) ailing, the pressure falls to players like Brandon Graham and Malik Jackson to turn up the heat. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Eagles running back Miles Sanders will rush for at least 150 yards. The Bengals' run defense has been woeful through the first two weeks of the season. With defensive tackles Geno Atkins and Mike Daniels potentially out for another week, Sanders could be in for a big day. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz has struggled with accuracy this season. He's completing just 58.8% of his passes, well below his expected completion percentage of 67.7%, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. That's the second-worst completion percentage over expectation (minus-8.8%) in the NFL, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, behind Dwayne Haskins (10.6%). And after throwing multiple interceptions two times all of last season, Wentz has thrown two in each of his first two games this year. No Eagles QB has done so in three straight games since Ron Jaworski in 1985. What to know for fantasy: Burrow's 61 pass attempts were the highlight of Thursday Night Football, but don't overlook his 15 rushing attempts this season (fifth most among QBs). See Week 3 rankings.

" What to watch for: What will the Colts' defense do against a banged-up Jets offense? The Colts are coming off a game with three sacks against the Vikings, and the Jets will likely be without their starting running back, center, right tackle and top three receivers. Indianapolis should be able to keep its status as the NFL's best defense by the end of Sunday. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Colts defensive end Justin Houston and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner will combine for at least three sacks against the Jets' banged-up offensive line, which likely will be without center Connor McGovern and right tackle George Fant. Houston usually lines up over the left tackle, but he could flip sides. Rookie left tackle Mekhi Becton is the Jets' best lineman at the moment. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: Indianapolis receiver T.Y. Hilton now has 13 consecutive games with fewer than 100 receiving yards, dating back to 2018 -- the longest streak of his career. And he has seven consecutive games without a receiving TD, tied for the second-longest such streak of his career and his longest since 2015-16 (also seven straight). What to know for fantasy: In his first career start, Jonathan Taylor was one of two backs to carry the ball 20 times and rack up over 100 rushing yards in Week 2. Since 2015, teams playing with a lead run the ball 46.6% of the time (30.9% when trailing), and the Colts are the biggest favorite of Week 3. See Week 3 rankings.

" What to watch for: Will Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert be even better after working all week with the starters? He drew praise from his coaches after stepping into the starting lineup in Week 2 just minutes before kickoff. Now they've had a week to work with him. Coach Anthony Lynn says he's as shy on the field as off it, but he looked sharp in his debut for the most part. -- Shelley Smith Bold prediction: The Panthers will get a sack and two QB pressures. Not bold? Consider that the Panthers still have no sacks through two games and only six pressures. But with the tendency of rookie quarterbacks to hold on to the ball too long trying to make a play, this feels like the game the sack-less streak ends. -- David Newton Stat to know: The Chargers have called a designed rush on 54% of their offensive plays this season, the second-highest rate in the NFL behind only the Rams (55%), after ranking 25th in the NFL in designed rush percentage last season (36%). What to know for fantasy: Los Angeles receiver Mike Williams' target share dropped from 33.3% in Week 1 to 12.9% in Week 2 with Herbert under center. See Week 3 rankings.

" What to watch for: Russell Wilson and the Seahawks' passing game have a favorable matchup against Dallas' banged-up defense. The Seahawks have leaned more on Wilson over the first two games, and he has delivered, including a five-touchdown performance last week against New England's strong secondary. Now he faces a Cowboys defense that won't have cornerback Chidobe Awuzie or linebacker Leighton Vander Esch. With Seattle dealing with defensive issues of its own, this game has shootout potential. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Wilson will throw for more than 300 yards. Yes, he has thrown for 610 yards with nine touchdowns and just 11 incompletions in the first two games, but before you question my boldness, consider this: In five games against the Cowboys for his career, Wilson is averaging just 154.4 yards through the air. He has completed 78 of 125 passes for 772 yards in those five games. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: Wilson has completed 52 of 63 passes this season (82.5%) for the highest completion percentage in NFL history by a QB with at least 50 pass attempts through two games. And now he is looking to become just the fifth player ever to throw for four touchdowns in three consecutive games (Peyton Manning, Dan Marino, Patrick Mahomes and Drew Brees). What to know for fantasy: Both Wilson and Dak Prescott are top-five QBs through two weeks, but Seattle has a pair of top-15 wide receivers, while the Cowboys don't have even one. See Week 3 rankings.

" What to watch for: C'mon, it's Tom Brady. Now that he's moved to the NFC, this might be his last game in Denver, where Brady faces a statistical quirk in his storied career -- the Broncos are the only team he does not have a winning record against. He has faced the Broncos 17 times in his career and is 8-9 overall against them (7-6 in the regular season, 1-3 in the playoffs). It will be a struggle for the injury-ravaged Broncos to keep Brady from getting back to .500, but to have any shot at stopping him, they will have to find a way to generate more of a pass rush. Denver cranked up five-man rush packages just four times against the Steelers last week and surrendered touchdowns on two of those plays. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: The Buccaneers will notch five more sacks this week, with three coming from Shaquil Barrett. Champing at the bit for his first sack of 2020 and returning to Mile High as the 2019 sack champion, the former Bronco has been primarily rushing from the left side this year, and right tackle Elijah Wilkinson has had 4.0 sacks against attributed to him in two games -- more than any other player in the league. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Denver tight end Noah Fant is averaging 14.3 yards per reception since entering NFL in 2019, a rate that ranks second among tight ends in that time (Jared Cook, 16.0). He could become the first Broncos player with a receiving TD in three straight games since Demaryius Thomas did it in 2017. What to know for fantasy: The Buccaneers D/ST ranks eighth in fantasy points this season, and the Broncos are allowing pressure at the third-highest rate. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The over has hit in 14 of the past 16 Buccaneers games. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Cardinals' offense keeps getting better every week, while the Lions have given up 27 and 42 points in the first two weeks, respectively. That doesn't bode well for Detroit taming Arizona, which should put on another offensive show and, perhaps, announce its arrival as one of the NFL's teams to watch this season. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Arizona quarterback Kyler Murray will have a 100-yard rushing and 250-yard passing day against the Lions. Detroit's defense has struggled against both the run and the pass this season, a large part of the Lions' 0-2 start. Considering Detroit's inability to create a pass rush with its defensive line (one sack, one quarterback hit), Murray might have the option to either take off or sit back and watch. Watch for him to take advantage of it over and over again Sunday. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: The Lions have lost 11 straight games, the longest active losing streak in the NFL and the team's longest since it dropped 19 in a row over the 2007-09 seasons. The Lions have also lost four straight games dating back to last season in which they led by 10-plus points at some point, and according to the Elias Sports Bureau, they're the first team in NFL history to blow a double-digit lead in four straight games. What to know for fantasy: The list of active wide receivers with more touchdown receptions than Marvin Jones Jr. since 2017 is short: DeAndre Hopkins, Davante Adams and Tyreek Hill. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The Lions have failed to cover in their past six road games. Read more.",56.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This one features two of the greatest QBs in NFL history, and both are still on a quest for that elusive second Super Bowl. This could be Drew Brees' last season at age 41, and he should be extra motivated to silence those predicting his demise after a slow start to the season. On the flip side, Aaron Rodgers is off to a great start, so we haven't heard any hot takes about rookie Jordan Love waiting in the wings to replace him. ""It's like when Peyton [Manning] and Tom [Brady] used to play,"" says NBC analyst Tony Dungy. ""It's a team game, but they understood they were gonna have to be on top of their game for their team to win."" -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: I've got this one soaring past the over with 60-plus points. This is the fifth meeting between Rodgers and Brees, and the average combined point total in those games was 69.5, the highest-scoring quarterback matchup in the Super Bowl era, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The Packers have scored 40-plus in each of their first two games, and even though Brees & Co. have struggled, it's not like they're facing a defensive juggernaut in Green Bay's unit. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: The Packers lead the NFL in offensive efficiency rating (94.0) and are one of four teams to record 500-plus passing yards and 400-plus rushing yards through their first two games of a season since the merger in 1970. The previous three -- 2019 Ravens, 1998 49ers, and 1978 Cowboys -- all went on to make the playoffs. What to know for fantasy: Brees has scored under 15 fantasy points in consecutive games, something he didn't do in 2019. His upside is limited, given that he is averaging 4.8 air yards per throw this season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: New Orleans is playing its second straight prime-time game. Teams playing their second straight prime-time game are 16-26-1 ATS in the past three seasons, and 106-126-3 ATS in the past 20 seasons. Read more.",61.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Ravens jump out to another early lead? Since Lamar Jackson took over as Baltimore's starter midway through the 2018 season, the Ravens are an NFL-best 19-0 when leading at halftime and 0-5 (including the playoffs) when trailing after two quarters. The Ravens haven't trailed at any point in the second half in their past 12 games, which is the third-best streak in league history. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: The Chiefs and Ravens will combine for 900-plus yards and at least 60 points. Both teams are in the top 10 in points allowed, but don't look for a defensive battle. This game will be similar to the one from Week 3 last season, when the meeting produced 955 yards and 61 points. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: The Ravens have won 14 straight regular-season games, and the Chiefs have won eight straight -- the two longest active win streaks in the NFL. The last time two teams on eight-plus-game win streaks met was 1969, when the Rams (11 straight) hosted the Vikings (10 straight). This also marks the fifth QB matchup between the reigning MVP (Jackson) and Super Bowl MVP (Patrick Mahomes). The Super Bowl MVP won the previous four matchups. What to know for fantasy: The quarterbacks will get the headlines, but when these two teams met in Week 3 last season, there were three running backs who reached double-figure point totals. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: In the past 20 seasons, reigning Super Bowl champions are 11-1 ATS as underdogs within the first three weeks of the season. And Mahomes is 10-2 ATS in September games with 28 passing TDs and zero interceptions. Read more.",63.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Bills quarterback Josh Allen leads the NFL in scramble yards since entering the league in 2018, but Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald ranks second in the league in sacks since 2014. It's unstoppable force meets immovable object, and something's got to give. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Rams running back Darrell Henderson Jr. rushes for 100-plus yards. Yes, the Bills rank third in the NFL in rushing defense, allowing an average of 75.5 rushing yards per game, but Henderson gained 121 all-purpose yards in a Week 2 win, and he says he wasn't even 100 percent with a lingering hamstring injury. Watch for him to find another gear in a breakout performance. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Stefon Diggs has 239 receiving yards this season, tied for the most in the NFL. The most receiving yards through the first three games of a season in Bills history is 352, by Peerless Price in 2002. What to know for fantasy: Two of Allen's top five fantasy games of his career have come this season, and he's averaging 65% more points per pass attempt than he did last season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The Rams are 13-5 against the spread (ATS) since the start of last season (2-0 this season). Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How the Patriots plan to cover Raiders tight end Darren Waller (18 receptions) is the game within the game. In Week 1, second-year defensive back Joejuan Williams was primarily assigned to cover Dolphins tight end Mike Gesicki, but that's because the Patriots viewed Gesicki as more of a wide receiver. Waller has a more complete skill set that makes him a true tight end, and the Raiders move him around a lot, even putting him in the backfield at times. So finding and locating Waller is the first challenge. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: Patriots quarterback Cam Newton will rush for at least two touchdowns. At an athletic 6-foot-5, 245 pounds, he is bigger than any linebacker or defensive back the Raiders have on their active roster. So you know Newton, called a ""power forward"" by Raiders coach Jon Gruden, is champing at the bit to run the read-option. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: The Raiders have the second-highest offensive efficiency rating (90.6) in the NFL through Week 2 (Packers, 94.0). They have scored 30-plus points in their first two games but have not done so in three straight games since 2016 (Weeks 7-9), the last season they made the playoffs. What to know for fantasy: Waller saw a career-high 16 targets in Week 2, and his 24 targets through two weeks are the third most in the NFL. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: New England is 51-26 ATS after a loss in the Bill Belichick era, including 40-15 ATS since 2003. Read more.",58.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will the Vikings' offense be able to keep up with Tennessee's scoring pace? Minnesota's defense has struggled to get its opponents off the field, and the lack of opportunities for its offensive playmakers not named Adam Thielen has been noticeable. Is this the week when the offense leans heavily on running back Dalvin Cook, and can quarterback Kirk Cousins finally involve rookie receiver Justin Jefferson and/or tight end Irv Smith Jr.? -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Titans QB Ryan Tannehill will finish with 300-plus passing yards. That might not seem bold, but here's something to consider: Tannehill has finished with 300 or more passing yards only three times since taking over in Week 7 last season. Defenses are focused on stopping Derrick Henry, which presents one-on-one matchups for the receivers. Tannehill and the passing game should have the advantage against a depleted Vikings secondary in those situations. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Titans are seeking their first 3-0 start since 2008 (started 10-0 and finished 13-3), and the Vikings are trying to avoid their first 0-3 start since 2013 (the last Vikings team to lose 10-plus games). What to know for fantasy: Since 2018, Henry is averaging 54.4% more points per game when his team is favored than when it is the underdog. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota is 7-3 ATS as a home underdog under Mike Zimmer, including the playoffs. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Steelers have blitzed 64% of the time this season, the most in the NFL by a wide margin, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. And Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson has the second-worst Total QBR against the blitz. Though Watson is the best signal-caller the Steelers have faced this season, look for the defense to still get a ton of pressure on the quarterback -- and from everywhere on the field. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: J.J. Watt and T.J. Watt will combine for five sacks. The Watt brothers usually have to check their phones after playing in a game to see how the other pass-rusher did, but on Sunday, they'll get to play in front of each other. In Week 2, the Watts combined for 4.5 sacks, which was the second most by a set of brothers in a single day in NFL history. They'll top that on Sunday. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: The Steelers have started 2-0 for the seventh time in the Ben Roethlisberger era (since 2004). They went on to make the playoffs in each of the past six instances (2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2016 and 2017). The Texans, on the other hand, are off to an 0-2 start for the third time in the past six seasons (2015 and 2018). But they recovered to make the playoffs in each of the previous two instances. What to know for fantasy: Pittsburgh running back James Conner sure looked healthy in Week 2, as he piled up 97.2% of the Steelers' rushing yards. He was the only running back with a rate north of 85% last week. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Pittsburgh is 7-13-2 ATS as a favorite since 2018. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Who is playing -- and where -- for each team? The 49ers are without their top two running backs, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, Defensive Rookie of the Year Nick Bosa and several others. The Giants are missing Saquon Barkley and Sterling Shepard. Who takes their spots? And can they be capable fill-ins? Start with 49ers backup quarterback Nick Mullens and newly signed Giants running back Devonta Freeman. All eyes will be on those two. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: 49ers running back Jerick McKinnon will have his first 100-plus-yard rushing game since 2014 and just the third in his career. With Raheem Mostert and Tevin Coleman out because of knee sprains, McKinnon will have an expanded role this week, and he gets it against a Giants defense that has been shoddy against the run over the first two weeks and hasn't seen a rushing attack as dangerous as the Niners' unit yet. McKinnon will take advantage and reach the end zone for the third time in as many weeks. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: Giants quarterback Daniel Jones has nine games with at least two turnovers since 2019, tied with Jameis Winston for the most in the NFL in that span -- and that includes three straight dating back to last season. What to know for fantasy: It's been over 1,000 days since McKinnon (roughly 80% available) has had 15 carries in a game, but with Mostert and Coleman out, the path to volume has been paved. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Since 2017, the Giants are 2-14 ATS as a home underdog of less than seven points. Read more.",39.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Falcons are 0-2 in a must-win season for coach Dan Quinn, and a home loss to a subpar Bears team would make Quinn's hot seat even hotter. The Falcons have to stick to the formula of balance on offense and creating turnovers on defense. A rash of injuries to players such as Julio Jones and Dante Fowler Jr. might be their big obstacle this week, but the game is too critical to use injuries as a crutch. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: Bears running back David Montgomery rushes for 100-plus yards for just the third time in his NFL career. Chicago had one of the worst rushing attacks in 2019, but head coach Matt Nagy entered the season with a renewed determination to run the football. Montgomery gained 82 yards on the ground in 16 carries versus the Giants last Sunday. The former third-round pick, who dealt with a groin injury over the summer, is on the verge of having a breakout performance. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: After catching a pair in each of Atlanta's first two games of the season, Falcons receiver Calvin Ridley now has 21 career receiving touchdowns, the second most by a Falcons player over his first three seasons (Andre Rison, 22). What to know for fantasy: The Falcons have allowed the top-scoring fantasy QB in each of the first two weeks, and Mitchell Trubisky does have the third-best fantasy quarter by a QB this season (Week 1, fourth quarter).

He could become the first Broncos player with a receiving TD in three straight games since Demaryius Thomas did it in 2017. What to know for fantasy: The Buccaneers D/ST ranks eighth in fantasy points this season, and the Broncos are allowing pressure at the third-highest rate. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The over has hit in 14 of the past 16 Buccaneers games. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Cardinals' offense keeps getting better every week, while the Lions have given up 27 and 42 points in the first two weeks, respectively. That doesn't bode well for Detroit taming Arizona, which should put on another offensive show and, perhaps, announce its arrival as one of the NFL's teams to watch this season. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Arizona quarterback Kyler Murray will have a 100-yard rushing and 250-yard passing day against the Lions. Detroit's defense has struggled against both the run and the pass this season, a large part of the Lions' 0-2 start. Considering Detroit's inability to create a pass rush with its defensive line (one sack, one quarterback hit), Murray might have the option to either take off or sit back and watch. Watch for him to take advantage of it over and over again Sunday. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: The Lions have lost 11 straight games, the longest active losing streak in the NFL and the team's longest since it dropped 19 in a row over the 2007-09 seasons. The Lions have also lost four straight games dating back to last season in which they led by 10-plus points at some point, and according to the Elias Sports Bureau, they're the first team in NFL history to blow a double-digit lead in four straight games. What to know for fantasy: The list of active wide receivers with more touchdown receptions than Marvin Jones Jr. since 2017 is short: DeAndre Hopkins, Davante Adams and Tyreek Hill. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The Lions have failed to cover in their past six road games. Read more.",56.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This one features two of the greatest QBs in NFL history, and both are still on a quest for that elusive second Super Bowl. This could be Drew Brees' last season at age 41, and he should be extra motivated to silence those predicting his demise after a slow start to the season. On the flip side, Aaron Rodgers is off to a great start, so we haven't heard any hot takes about rookie Jordan Love waiting in the wings to replace him. ""It's like when Peyton [Manning] and Tom [Brady] used to play,"" says NBC analyst Tony Dungy. ""It's a team game, but they understood they were gonna have to be on top of their game for their team to win."" -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: I've got this one soaring past the over with 60-plus points. This is the fifth meeting between Rodgers and Brees, and the average combined point total in those games was 69.5, the highest-scoring quarterback matchup in the Super Bowl era, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The Packers have scored 40-plus in each of their first two games, and even though Brees & Co. have struggled, it's not like they're facing a defensive juggernaut in Green Bay's unit. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: The Packers lead the NFL in offensive efficiency rating (94.0) and are one of four teams to record 500-plus passing yards and 400-plus rushing yards through their first two games of a season since the merger in 1970. The previous three -- 2019 Ravens, 1998 49ers, and 1978 Cowboys -- all went on to make the playoffs. What to know for fantasy: Brees has scored under 15 fantasy points in consecutive games, something he didn't do in 2019. His upside is limited, given that he is averaging 4.8 air yards per throw this season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: New Orleans is playing its second straight prime-time game. Teams playing their second straight prime-time game are 16-26-1 ATS in the past three seasons, and 106-126-3 ATS in the past 20 seasons. Read more.",61.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Ravens jump out to another early lead? Since Lamar Jackson took over as Baltimore's starter midway through the 2018 season, the Ravens are an NFL-best 19-0 when leading at halftime and 0-5 (including the playoffs) when trailing after two quarters. The Ravens haven't trailed at any point in the second half in their past 12 games, which is the third-best streak in league history. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: The Chiefs and Ravens will combine for 900-plus yards and at least 60 points. Both teams are in the top 10 in points allowed, but don't look for a defensive battle. This game will be similar to the one from Week 3 last season, when the meeting produced 955 yards and 61 points. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: The Ravens have won 14 straight regular-season games, and the Chiefs have won eight straight -- the two longest active win streaks in the NFL. The last time two teams on eight-plus-game win streaks met was 1969, when the Rams (11 straight) hosted the Vikings (10 straight). This also marks the fifth QB matchup between the reigning MVP (Jackson) and Super Bowl MVP (Patrick Mahomes). The Super Bowl MVP won the previous four matchups. What to know for fantasy: The quarterbacks will get the headlines, but when these two teams met in Week 3 last season, there were three running backs who reached double-figure point totals. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: In the past 20 seasons, reigning Super Bowl champions are 11-1 ATS as underdogs within the first three weeks of the season. And Mahomes is 10-2 ATS in September games with 28 passing TDs and zero interceptions. Read more.",63.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can Raiders quarterback Derek Carr improve his play at Arrowhead Stadium? That would seem necessary if the Raiders are to beat the Chiefs in Kansas City for the first time since 2012. Carr is 0-6 against the Chiefs on the road, with four touchdown passes, seven interceptions, a QBR of 14.4 and a long pass of 33 yards. The Chiefs have changed players, coordinators, systems and tactics against Carr, and everything has continued to work. The Raiders have been outscored 75-12 in two games against the Chiefs at Arrowhead since Patrick Mahomes became Kansas City's starting QB. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Carr will not be picked off and will extend his interception-free streak to nine games. The last time Carr was intercepted was Dec. 1, 2019, when he was picked off twice ... at Arrowhead Stadium. But he is completing passes at a 73.6% clip this season with short, safe throws, and he will have to control the ball to keep Mahomes off the field. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Mahomes' 89.1 Total QBR against the Raiders is his highest against any team that he has played more than once, and his 11 passing touchdowns in four games -- in which he went 4-0 -- is the highest total he has against any NFL team. What to know for fantasy: Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill is the first Kansas City player with at least six targets and a TD reception in four straight games since Dwayne Bowe did it in five straight in 2010. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: All four Raiders games have gone over the total this season. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Can Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow continue his unprecedented start this week against the Ravens? He set an NFL record on Sunday by becoming the first rookie quarterback in NFL history to throw for 300 or more yards in three straight games. Since John Harbaugh became coach of the Ravens in 2008, Baltimore is 12-1 against rookie QBs at home, allowing just four to surpass 300 yards passing. The Ravens also have recorded 16 interceptions against rookie starters in Baltimore during the Harbaugh era, while producing five times as many sacks (36) as TD passes given up (seven). -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: The Ravens will rush for 200 total yards. One of the strongest rush offenses in the league is going up against one of the league's worst rushing defenses. Between that and the rushing ability of Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson, it could be a big day for the Ravens' ground game. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: The Bengals haven't gone three straight games without a loss in a single season since starting 8-0 in 2015, and they haven't had consecutive wins since Weeks 4 and 5 of the 2018 season. What to know for fantasy: Cincinnati running back Joe Mixon has failed to average over 4.0 yards per carry in four straight matchups with the Ravens. In those games, he has averaged 3.1 yards per carry, with no rush gaining more than 21 yards. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Jackson is 4-8 ATS as a home favorite since becoming the Ravens' starting QB in 2018. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Steelers are fired up after not getting to play in Week 4 because of a COVID-19 outbreak in Tennessee. The team was on a roll to start the season at 3-0, and it looking to go 4-0 for the first time since 1979 -- a season that ended in a Super Bowl. Look for the Steelers to unleash the frustration of last week while also trying to get back into the rhythm of a balanced offense and a complementary defense they established in the Week 3 win against the Texans. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: The Steelers and Eagles will combine for eight total sacks. Philadelphia (17) and Pittsburgh (15) are Nos. 1 and No. 2 in sacks at the quarter mark of the season. The pass rush that comes up the biggest on Sunday will swing the outcome of this game. One particular matchup to keep an eye on is Eagles left tackle Jordan Mailata against Bud Dupree. Mailata is making his second career start, and Dupree has registered 2.5 takedowns through three games this season. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has seven passing touchdowns through his team's first three games, whereas Philadelphia signal-caller Carson Wentz has seven interceptions through his squad's opening four contests. Wentz's seven picks are the most in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Since Week 15 of the 2017 season, just once has a player rushed for 90 yards against the Steelers in Pittsburgh. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Philadelphia is 3-0 ATS against Pittsburgh since 2008. Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: All eyes will be on new Washington starting quarterback Kyle Allen's performance. Washington benched Dwayne Haskins Jr. after four lackluster games, with concerns about his maturation as an NFL quarterback. Allen knows the offense better, having played under Ron Rivera with the Panthers, and the coaches are hoping Allen makes the plays they feel have been available. But Allen has to take care of the ball; he turned it over 15 times in his last seven starts with Carolina in 2019. That includes three lost fumbles, so he must do a better job against a team that ranks fifth in the NFL with 12 sacks. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Rams running back Darrell Henderson Jr., who was quiet in Week 3, will break out for the second 100-yard rushing game of his career. The Rams are coming off an uninspiring offensive performance against the Giants, so watch for L.A. to establish the running game early against a Washington team that is allowing an average of 129.8 rushing yards per game. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Washington is just 33.3% in converting on third down this season, the worst mark in the NFL. And that's actually an improvement from 2019, when it was 29.1% (also last). What to know for fantasy: Washington running back Antonio Gibson has a rushing score and at least 12 touches in three straight games. During those three games, his 1.16 PPR points per touch ranks eighth among qualifiers -- ahead of Dalvin Cook among others. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: The Rams are 6-2 ATS as a road favorite of at least six points under Sean McVay. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Falcons desperately need a win with Dan Quinn's job status in limbo, but the coach has preached to his team that the first NFC South game offers a chance for a new start. Although wide receiver Julio Jones' health situation remains unclear as he comes off a hamstring injury, the Falcons are on track to get some key players back in A.J. Terrell, Ricardo Allen and Takkarist McKinley. The sense of desperation should have the Falcons clicking better in the first home game with fans. -- Vaughn McClure Bold prediction: The Panthers will leave Atlanta above .500. That is about as bold as it gets for a team that started the year 0-2, opened as a 2.5-point underdog to an 0-4 team and hasn't won at Atlanta since 2014. But the Panthers have momentum with two straight wins. -- David Newton Stat to know: The Falcons are 0-4 for the first time since 1999, and a loss to Carolina would mark their first 0-5 start since 1997. What to know for fantasy: Carolina running back Mike Davis is averaging seven receptions per game this season, not much different than the 7.3 grabs Christian McCaffrey averaged during his historic 2019. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Panthers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is 18-4 ATS and 11-11 outright in his career as an underdog. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Texans haven't topped 23 points even once in four games this season, but the Jaguars have allowed 30 or more in three straight games. Will Houston's offense rebound in the first game since the firing of Bill O'Brien on Monday? This is their best matchup of the season so far and a good place to get going after a lackluster start. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson will throw for 330-plus yards and four TDs. The Jaguars' pass defense has been bad over the past month; they can't get pressure, and the coverage has been spotty, at best. Watson should have no trouble moving the ball. And even if rookie cornerback CJ Henderson plays, he is dealing with a shoulder injury and has been just OK after an impressive debut in the season opener. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Romeo Crennel will become the oldest head coach in NFL history. The Texans' interim will be 73 years, 115 days old on Sunday. Only George Halas and Marv Levy have coached a game at over 70 years old, per Elias Sports Bureau data. What to know for fantasy: Jacksonville tailback James Robinson joins Alvin Kamara as the only players with 100 total yards in each of the past three weeks. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Teams that replace their head coach during the season are 14-22 ATS in the first game with their successor since 2000 (13-23 straight up). Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Forget about elite; Jets quarterback Joe Flacco, starting for the injured Sam Darnold, will be hard-pressed to reach ""average."" He hasn't started a game in nearly a year, and he has had very little practice time after missing training camp. A rusty, immobile quarterback behind a leaky offensive line is not a good combination. The Jets are 31st in red zone efficiency, while the Arizona defense is fourth. Do the math. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: The Cardinals will put up 40 on the lowly Jets, who are allowing 32.8 points per game, the third most in the NFL. The Cardinals are averaging 24.5 points per game, but their offense is due for a breakout after struggling over the past two weeks. And what's a better time to do it than against one of the worst teams in football? -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: Arizona wideout DeAndre Hopkins has 39 receptions, which leads the NFL. He needs nine against the Jets to break the record for the most catches through a team's first five games of a season. What to know for fantasy: Arizona QB Kyler Murray and Buffalo QB Josh Allen are the only two players, regardless of position, with at least 21 fantasy points in all four weeks this season. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: The Jets are 0-4 ATS this season. They are failing to cover games by 10.5 points per game, the worst cover differential in the NFL this season. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will the 49ers bounce back after a disappointing defeat last week? The Niners have dropped both of their home games, and though last week's loss to Philadelphia could be explained by a combination of injuries and a hangover from a long stay out East, they should have that out of their system and could be welcoming back more key pieces. The Dolphins, meanwhile, have to make one of the league's longest trips for this one. If the Niners fall to 2-3 before entering the meat of their schedule, their postseason hopes could slip away sooner rather than later. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: Dolphins running back Matt Breida breaks off a 50-plus-yard touchdown against his former team. Breida has had only one play over 11 yards so far this year in a surprisingly limited role, but he has started to show more of his explosiveness and figures to have a bigger role in this game against a banged-up 49ers defense. Breida spent the first three years of his career with the 49ers before being traded for a fifth-round pick in a draft weekend deal, and though he doesn't have any animosity toward his former team, it's likely he'll want to prove they made a mistake. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: 49ers tight end George Kittle posted 183 receiving yards in Week 4 for his ninth career game of 100-plus yards. But he has never had consecutive games with at least 100 receiving yards. What to know for fantasy: Miami wide receiver DeVante Parker's yardage total has increased each week this season, and he has 21.8 more points through four weeks this season than he did during his 2019 breakout. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is 6-11-1 ATS at home over the past three seasons. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Cleveland's NFL-leading running game -- now without Nick Chubb -- is up against Indy's top-five run defense. This should be a litmus tests for both sides in a true matchup of strength against strength. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: The Colts will give up 125 yards rushing. Indianapolis will keep the Browns' rushing offense in check most of the game, regardless of whether the Colts have linebacker Darius Leonard (groin). But Indy will give up one big ""chunk"" run that will wind up hurting it in the fourth quarter. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton has now gone 15 straight games with fewer than 100 receiving yards, dating back to 2018. It's the longest streak of his career; his last game with 100-plus yards came with Andrew Luck at QB. What to know for fantasy: Browns wideout Odell Beckham Jr.'s 38.4 PPR points last week led all receivers and ranked third across all positions. But can he sustain the success? He hasn't had consecutive 25-point games since Weeks 13 and 14 of the 2015 season. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Indianapolis has had three straight games go under the total, and it has covered all three games. Read more.",41.0,LOW
" What to watch for: New York offensive coordinator Jason Garrett's unit needs to get going against the Dallas defense. In their past three games, the Cowboys' defense has allowed four, five and six touchdowns to Atlanta, Seattle and Cleveland, respectively. The Giants have scored three TDs in their first four games, but the Cowboys' defense might be the perfect slumpbuster. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Dallas wide receiver Michael Gallup tops 100 yards with 2 TDs. Forget that Gallup is coming off a quiet game (2-58-0) against the Falcons. The Giants' defensive weakness is that No. 2 cornerback across from James Bradberry. Whether it's Isaac Yiadom or Ryan Lewis out there, expect Dak Prescott to exploit the matchup, leading to a big day for Gallup. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: The Giants have just 306 rushing yards this season, second worst in the NFL and the eighth-fewest total though four games in franchise history. Only twice have they been held under 350 rushing yards through five games (1942 and 2013). What to know for fantasy: Prescott's torrid pace cannot be overstated, but don't forget that there are only six quarterbacks (Prescott being one of them) to have scored more fantasy points than the Cowboys have allowed to the position. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Dallas is 10-2 ATS against the NFC East over the past three seasons. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson continue his historic start and his excellence in prime time? He has thrown 16 touchdown passes this season, tied for the most in NFL history through a team's first four games. And he has a combined 26-7-1 record over his career in Sunday night, Monday night and Thursday night games. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Seattle achieving its first 5-0 start in franchise history isn't that bold. You know what is? Wilson and the Seahawks accomplishing that feat in spite of Vikings wideouts Justin Jefferson and Adam Thielen each scoring a touchdown and posting over 100 yards receiving. Seattle's defense has allowed 94 catches and 1,345 yards to receivers in the first four games of the season, and that trend is set to continue in Week 5. It's going to take Wilson another shootout to beat the Vikings on Sunday Night Football. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Minnesota running back Dalvin Cook has 424 rushing yards this season, the most in the NFL. The highest total for a Vikings player through five games in the past 20 seasons is 607 by Adrian Peterson in 2007. What to know for fantasy: Cook's touch count has increased each week this season, and he ranks as RB3 despite ranking 16th in expected fantasy points per rush. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins is 6-15-1 ATS in prime-time games in his career (7-14 outright). Read more.",62.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: This will be a fun quarterback duel between 20-year veteran Drew Brees and rookie Justin Herbert. But what really defines this matchup, unfortunately, is the overwhelming number of injuries that have plagued both sides. The Saints could potentially get Michael Thomas back from his Week 1 ankle injury. Meanwhile, the Chargers just lost dynamic running back Austin Ekeler for four to six weeks with a hamstring injury. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: The Chargers will finally get a win now that Herbert has been named the regular starting QB. He will go into the game with confidence, but the Chargers need to stop beating themselves with turnovers. -- Shelley Smith Stat to know: Brees was 5-for-8 for 111 yards and a touchdown on throws of 15-plus yards downfield in Week 4. In the first three games of the campaign, he had just seven such completions and zero touchdowns. What to know for fantasy: Saints running back Alvin Kamara has been a top-10 RB every week this season and is pacing for 320 touches (current career high is 275). See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: New Orleans is 6-9 ATS over the past five seasons when favored by seven or more points at home. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Titans are without several key players, including Adam Humphries, Jeffery Simmons and Corey Davis, who have been placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list. And the team hasn't practiced or been in its facility to prepare for this game. Keep an eye on how they start the game after having so much time off. If Tennessee gets off to a slow start, this could get ugly quickly. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: The Bills finally get lose in the running game for at least 150 yards. They rank 28th in the league in rushing yards per game, but the Titans rank 29th in rushing yards allowed. It's a true matchup of a stoppable force meeting a movable object. But Buffalo's ranking seems more like an outlier, given its top-10 finish last season and improved backfield. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: Tennessee quarterback Ryan Tannehill is averaging 11.2 yards per attempt with play-action (fourth) but just 5.9 per attempt without play-action (28th). What to know for fantasy: Last week, Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen tied the longest streak in Bills history with his fourth straight game of 280 passing yards and multiple touchdown passes. The only other instance of that for the Bills was Drew Bledsoe in 2002. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Tennessee is the third team in Super Bowl era to start 3-0 straight up and 0-3 against the spread (ATS). Read more.",59.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Opposing tight ends have racked up 32 catches for 323 yards and five touchdowns through five games against the Eagles, with much of that damage coming against a struggling linebacking corps. Enter Baltimore's Mark Andrews, who is tied for third in the NFL with five receiving scores. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson will throw at least four TD passes. Jackson, last season's NFL leader in touchdown passes, hasn't thrown for more than three in a game since his MVP season. But the Eagles have allowed 10 touchdown passes this season, and only five teams have given up more. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz has a 53.1 Total QBR this season (25th in the NFL) and a league-leading nine interceptions. No Eagles QB has led the NFL in picks over a full season since the 1970 merger. What to know for fantasy: Jackson had just one game last season with fewer than 19 fantasy points. But he has been under 19 fantasy points in three of his past four games. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Jackson is 8-0 outright and 6-0-2 against the spread (ATS) in his career as a road favorite. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: After adequately controlling the run game in their first three games, the Steelers saw Miles Sanders and the Eagles exploit some of the weaknesses opened up by their aggressive blitzing. They'll have to stop the rush better to be successful against a hot Browns team. Even though Nick Chubb will be out, the Browns have a solid ground game with Kareem Hunt -- and quarterback Baker Mayfield's mobility makes him a running threat too. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Steelers wide receiver Chase Claypool will catch two more touchdowns, rewarding fantasy owners who added him after his four-TD outburst last weekend. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: The Browns have four consecutive wins for the first time since 2009, but they have not won five straight since 1994, when Bill Belichick was the head coach. One reason for the string of victories: Mayfield has tossed two touchdown passes in all of those four wins, his longest multi-TD streak since his five straight games back in 2018. What to know for fantasy: Cleveland's Hunt has been a top-27 RB in 11 of 13 games since joining the Browns. He caught 11 of 13 targets for 65 yards and a touchdown in his two games against the Steelers last season. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: All four of Cleveland's wins have gone over the total, and the team covered in the past three. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Titans will be creative in finding ways to pressure Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel was very aggressive last time out, sending defensive backs on the blitz. The Titans will also have Jeffery Simmons back to team up with Jadeveon Clowney on the inside, with Vic Beasley Jr. and Harold Landry III coming off the edge in their NASCAR package. They'll have to be disciplined and keep Watson from extending plays and finding his speedy receivers down the field. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Titans defensive lineman Clowney will get his first sack of the season against his former team. Clowney didn't get to face the Texans after they traded him to the Seahawks just before the 2019 season. His former defensive coordinator, Texans interim head coach Romeo Crennel, called the former No. 1 overall pick ""a very disruptive player,"" adding, ""I expect a great game from him, and he's going to try to play his best."" Watson has already been sacked 17 times, third most in the NFL. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: With Ryan Tannehill starting at quarterback, the Titans are 11-3 (.714) and have averaged 30.4 points per game. That's the best win percentage (minimum 10 starts) and most team points per game for a Titans/Oilers QB since the 1970 merger. What to know for fantasy: In his first season without DeAndre Hopkins, Watson is on pace to set new career highs in both passing touchdowns and passing yards. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Tennessee is 3-11 ATS in games that follow fewer than six days' rest since the start of the 2013 season. Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: What does an 0-5 team look like with a new coaching staff but a season likely past the point of being salvaged? Do the Falcons uncover a new identity or form of motivation to rattle off a series of wins under interim coach Raheem Morris? The scheme might not change, but what kind of stops does Atlanta pull out against a Vikings team scratching to keep its playoff hopes alive? -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan will throw three touchdown passes, tripling his total from the past three weeks combined. But it won't be enough, as Vikings running back Alexander Mattison does his best Dalvin Cook impersonation with more than 100 rushing yards and two scores of his own. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Atlanta wide receiver Calvin Ridley has an NFL-high four 100-yard receiving games this season. What to know for fantasy: After throwing four touchdown passes on 36 attempts in Week 2 against the Cowboys, Ryan has just one touchdown toss over the past three weeks (114 attempts). Over that stretch, Ryan is QB24 in total points, just 0.5 points ahead of a struggling Sam Darnold, who missed Week 5. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota is 23-10-1 ATS at home over the past five seasons, the best mark in the NFL. Read more.",58.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This game is all about pressure. Can the Panthers, who have not allowed a sack in two straight games, keep quarterback Teddy Bridgewater clean against Chicago's Akiem Hicks and Khalil Mack, who have 3.5 sacks each? And can the Panthers muster a pass rush with defensive end Brian Burns (concussion) doubtful and tackle Kawann Short now out for the season with a shoulder injury? -- David Newton Bold prediction: Bears rookie tight end Cole Kmet will catch at least five passes and one touchdown. Chicago's second-round pick (No. 43 overall) out of Notre Dame, Kmet has just one reception for 12 yards though five games. Quarterback Nick Foles attempted 42 passes in Week 5, but Kmet finished the game with zero targets and played just 21 of 63 offensive snaps. That has to change. The Bears have too much invested in Kmet for him to be a bystander, so look for Foles to target the rookie early and somewhat often on Sunday. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Panthers wide receiver Robby Anderson now has three 100-yard receiving games through five games this season. He had three such games all of last season with the Jets. What to know for fantasy: Carolina running back Mike Davis has a 15-yard rush, a 10-yard reception and at least five receptions in three straight games. Christian McCaffrey did not have such a streak last season. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Carolina is 3-0 both straight up and ATS in its past three games. Read more.",38.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Patriots totaled more than 200 rushing yards in each of their first two home games, and if they hit the mark again Sunday, they would match the 1976 and 1978 teams as the only ones to rush for 200 or more in three consecutive games. Quarterback Cam Newton's return, and his rushing prowess, will stress the Broncos' defense. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: The Broncos will force two turnovers. Why? Well ... because they're really, really due. And if they don't, this game could get ugly. The Broncos have been one of the league's worst in takeaways this season -- one interception and one fumble recovery in four games -- but the Patriots are tied for eighth in giveaways with seven. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Newton posted a Total QBR of 73 in the Patriots' first two games of the season. But then the quarterback play hit a snag, as Newton, Brian Hoyer and Jarrett Stidham combined to post a Total QBR of 28 in the past two outings. That was the worst team QBR in the league combined in Weeks 3 and 4. What to know for fantasy: When he gets at least 15 touches, Broncos running back Phillip Lindsay has averaged 15.6 fantasy points per game over his career. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Pats coach Bill Belichick is 23-11 ATS at home as a favorite over the past five seasons. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Keep an eye on the Colts' pass rush against Bengals QB Joe Burrow. One of the things the Colts, who have the NFL's No. 1-ranked defense, have struggled with this season has been getting to the quarterback; they're tied for 15th in the league in sacks (11). But leave it to the Bengals to come along at just the right time. Burrow has been sacked a league-high 22 times through five weeks. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: The Colts will have a plus-five sack differential. The matchup in pass protection is heavily tilted toward the Colts. Indianapolis protects the quarterback well, and the Bengals are depleted on the defensive line. On the flip side, Burrow has been sacked more than any other QB in the NFL. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Colts quarterback Philip Rivers has thrown four passing touchdowns this season, the fewest through his team's first five games of a season in his career. His low through six games is seven (2007 and 2011). Rivers has also gone under 250 passing yards in four straight; he hasn't done so in five straight since 2013-14. What to know for fantasy: Bengals running back Joe Mixon is on pace for 384 touches this season, a number that only Ezekiel Elliott, Le'Veon Bell, Christian McCaffrey and Derrick Henry have hit since 2015. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Indianapolis is 6-3 ATS as a home favorite since the start of last season, tied for the second-best cover percentage over that span. Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Look for Jaguars running back James Robinson to carry the ball more than 20 times. Jacksonville offensive coordinator Jay Gruden admitted he has abandoned the run way too soon in each of the Jaguars' past two games, so expect him to commit to Robinson pretty heavily against the Lions. And it makes sense because the Lions are giving up an NFL-worst 170.3 yards per game rushing. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford will look like the quarterback he was last season, throwing for 330 yards and three touchdowns, in a game that will still come down to the final possession due to Detroit's poor defense against Gardner Minshew -- who will also throw for 300 yards and two scores. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Minshew needs 235 passing yards to have the most ever by a Jaguars QB through six games. He can also join Mark Brunell (1999) as the only players in Jaguars history with three straight 300-yard passing games. What to know for fantasy: Robinson has at least 17 touches in every game this season, totaling at least 90 yards in four of those five games. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Detroit is 7-1 ATS coming off a bye since the start of the 2012 season. Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: We get Washington defensive end Chase Young up against Giants left tackle Andrew Thomas -- the No. 2 overall pick from April matched against the struggling No. 4 overall selection. It's been a rough start for Thomas, as he's ranked 61st out of 68 tackles in pass-block win rate (79.4%), an ESPN metric powered by NFL Next Gen Stats. Young, meanwhile, flashed his form early before missing some time with a groin injury. He returned last weekend and should be close to 100 percent and a handful for Thomas off the edge. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Washington defensive end Montez Sweat will take advantage of a weak New York offensive line and beat right tackle Cameron Fleming for a sack/fumble that leads to a deciding touchdown for Washington. Furthermore, Washington will record four sacks to break a three-game skid against the Giants. It ranks fifth in sacks with 15, but eight occurred in the opener. Against this line, Washington's pass rush will get healthy. -- John Keim Stat to know: The Giants are last in the NFL in rushing, with just 79.0 yards per game. But Washington is second to last at 81.4 rushing yards per game. What to know for fantasy: In Weeks 2-4, Giants wide receiver Darius Slayton totaled 134 yards on nine catches. In Week 5, he racked up 129 yards on eight catches against a divisional foe in the Cowboys. In Week 6, he gets another NFC East rival that has been routinely challenged deep down the field by opponents. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: In the past 35 seasons, when a team with an 0-5 or worse record is favored, the under is 12-6. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Dolphins are favored for the first time in 21 games (December 2018) and favored by more than a touchdown for the first time since November 2016. They haven't won back-to-back games by double digits since 2015, before the Brian Flores and Adam Gase eras in Miami, while the Jets have lost every game this season by at least nine points. Something has to give! -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: The Jets won't convert more than five third downs. They're 28th in third-down percentage, and the Miami defense is seventh. This will mean a long day for QB Joe Flacco, whose undefeated record against Miami (6-0) will be history. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: The Jets have started 0-6 only once in franchise history, in 1996. That team finished 1-15. As of now, the Jets have a league-high 43.6% chance to get the top pick in the 2021 NFL draft, according to FPI. What to know for fantasy: Miami quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick has scored at least 21 fantasy points in four straight games, the longest streak of his career. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami is 4-0 ATS against the Jets since the start of the 2018 season. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bucs are hopeful that Tom Brady can get back some of his weapons, such as wide receiver Chris Godwin and running back Leonard Fournette, along with a healthier Scotty Miller and Mike Evans. But the big question is how they'll replace 347-pound defensive tackle Vita Vea, who was a key reason the Buccaneers have had the league's top-ranked rushing defense over the past two years and why their pass rush has improved to be among the best. Who will try to rattle Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers now? -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: The Packers' defense will finally make a stand. Aaron Rodgers & Co. have carried the team to a 4-0 start, but after a bye week to figure out what has gone wrong, Mike Pettine's defense will find a way to come up big. Look for the Smiths (Preston Smith and Za'Darius Smith) to have success against the statuesque Brady, and Kenny Clark's return will help a run defense that so far has allowed nearly 5 yards per carry. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: The Packers' 93.3 offensive efficiency is the second highest through four team games since 2008 (95 by the Rams in 2018). And per the Elias Sport Bureau, Green Bay now has four consecutive games scoring at least 30 points with zero turnovers, tied for the second-longest streak in NFL history (2010 Patriots, seven straight). What to know for fantasy: Tampa Bay running back Ronald Jones is the only player in the NFL this season with multiple games of 100 rushing yards and five targets. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Green Bay is 4-0 ATS, making it the only undefeated team ATS left this season. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The 49ers' struggling offensive line gets its toughest test yet with Aaron Donald & Co. coming to town. The Rams are tied for the NFL lead with 20 sacks, and the Niners have allowed 18, fourth most in the league. Donald is capable of wrecking games by himself, and the Niners' interior line has been of particular concern. If San Francisco can't get it figured out in a hurry, it could be another long night. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: Donald will turn in his third multi-sack performance of the season. The defensive tackle is coming off a four-sack performance and will continue to wreak havoc in the backfield against the 49ers, whom he has 11.5 career sacks against. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Rams quarterback Jared Goff has a 70% completion rate in three consecutive road games, the second-longest streak in Rams history (Kurt Warner, five). What to know for fantasy: Los Angeles running back Darrell Henderson has three games with at least 14 touches this season. He has rushed for a score in all three of those games, and he even caught a touchdown last weekend at Washington. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is 0-3 ATS and straight up at home this season. The Niners' only two wins have come at MetLife Stadium (defeating the Giants and Jets). Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs is averaging a career-high 101.8 yards per game in 2020, good for second in the NFL. The Chiefs, on the other hand, have allowed two 100-yard receivers through five games this season. Look for quarterback Josh Allen and Buffalo offensive coordinator Brian Daboll to push that number to three come Monday. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire will again become a prominent part of the Chiefs' offense and will score his first touchdown since Week 1. While he might not have a huge game against Buffalo's rushing defense, the Chiefs will feature him more than they did last weekend against the Raiders, when he had 10 carries and three catches. The Chiefs abandoned their running game far too early against Las Vegas and won't make that mistake two weeks in a row, particularly with Sammy Watkins out of the lineup. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes began his 2018 MVP season by completing 64% of his passes for 1,513 yards, 14 touchdowns, two interceptions and an 86.1 Total QBR through five games. That stat line isn't too far from what Allen has done through five games this season: 69% passing, 1,589 yards, 14 touchdowns, three interceptions and an 85.2 Total QBR. What to know for fantasy: Mahomes has 235 passing yards, 20 rushing yards and multiple passing scores in four straight games. He is the first quarterback with a streak like that since Aaron Rodgers in 2016. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Kansas City is 7-1-1 ATS in Monday games under Andy Reid and 4-0-1 ATS on Monday night with Mahomes at quarterback. Read more.",65.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray is 6-0 all time at AT&T Stadium. He went 5-0 while at Allen High School, including three state championships, and 1-0 with Oklahoma, winning the Big 12 championship. The Cowboys are well aware of what he means to Arizona's offense. ""He has a unique skill set. He's so quick and explosive, and he can get the ball out of his hand very quickly,"" Dallas coach Mike McCarthy said. ""Obviously he can make any throw, he can hit all the quadrants of the field, and he's leading the league in rushing as quarterbacks. So I think that in itself tells you the stress that he puts on your defense. ... He's a dynamic player and he's definitely the centerpiece of that offense."" -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Murray will throw for 350 yards and run for another 100 in a reminder to everyone in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex that he's a legend there for a reason. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: The Cowboys have 11 turnovers this season, tied for most in the NFL. But the Cardinals have only three takeaways, tied for the third fewest. What to know for fantasy: Cardinals running back Chase Edmonds has 6.8 more points this season than Kenyan Drake ... on 54 fewer touches. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Arizona is the only team in the NFL to see all five of its games go under the total. Read more.",61.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Tennessee running back Derrick Henry's 588 yards on the ground leads all rushers. The Steelers' run defense is second in the NFL, allowing 66 yards per game despite rarely loading the box to stop the run. Tennessee's play-action passing game has produced big plays this season, so the difference will come down to how well quarterback Ryan Tannehill can keep the Titans' offense on schedule against a Pittsburgh defense blitzing 60% of the time when teams use play-action against it. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster will have two touchdowns. Smith-Schuster has been quiet the past two games with even distribution in the passing game. But with Chase Claypool breaking out and defenses taking notice, that could free up some room for Smith-Schuster to get free and score for the first time since Week 3. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: The Titans' offense has used play-action at the second-highest rate in the NFL since the start of 2019, and an NFL-high 47% of its passing yards in that span have come on play-action. Since Tannehill became the Titans' starter in Week 7 last season, his 92.1 QBR and 12.2 yards per attempt on play-action lead all NFL QBs, and his 15 TDs is tied with Kirk Cousins for the most in the NFL. But Pittsburgh's defense has been exceptional defending play-action, allowing the lowest QBR (38.9) and completion rate (57%) since the start of last season. What to know for fantasy: Henry, fresh off 212 rushing yards against the Texans, faces a Steelers defense that has yet to allow more than 80 rushing yards to any single player and is allowing the second-fewest fantasy points per game to RBs this season (16.5). See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: In the Super Bowl era, when teams that are 4-0 or better square off, the underdog is 10-4 against the spread (ATS). Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: No one expected this veteran Saints team to be just a half-game up on a Panthers squad that was overhauled from top to bottom this offseason. So as much as the Saints love seeing their old friend Teddy Bridgewater succeed, they would love to flex their muscles on him by finally playing their most complete game of the season. The Saints are hoping to reboot after the bye -- and it would help greatly if wide receiver Michael Thomas is able to return from ankle and hamstring injuries (he didn't practice on Thursday). -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: Bridgewater throws for more than 350 yards and four touchdowns against his old mates. Opposing quarterbacks have passed for 15 touchdowns to only three interceptions against the porous New Orleans defense, and Bridgewater knows that defense inside and out after spending the past two seasons with the Saints. -- David Newton Stat to know: Saints running back Alvin Kamara has four straight games of 100-plus scrimmage yards, the longest active streak in the NFL. He also leads all running backs in receiving yards this season with 395, 186 more than any other RB. Since 1950, there have been only three backs with 450-plus receiving yards in a team's first six games of a season: Timmy Brown in 1965 (510), Paul Hofer in 1980 (467) and Marshall Faulk in 2000 (462). What to know for fantasy: Saints quarterback Drew Brees was a top-eight quarterback in both matchups with the Panthers last season, amassing 564 passing yards and six touchdowns in the process. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Bridgewater is 18-4 ATS and 12-10 outright in his career as an underdog, including 2-2 straight up and ATS this season. Bridgewater is also 14-2 ATS as a road 'dog in his career. Read more.",58.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Texans' run defense rebound from a terrible performance against Derrick Henry and the Titans? Packers running back Aaron Jones has scored at least one touchdown in five consecutive games, which is tied for the longest active streak in the NFL, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: Jones' streak of consecutive games with a touchdown will end at five, but quarterback Aaron Rodgers will more than make up for it. It won't be a six-TD game like his only previous career start in Houston (in 2012), but look for Rodgers to get back on track after the abysmal showing at Tampa Bay last weekend. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: Texans running back David Johnson has 350 rushing yards and three rushing scores this season, more than he had in all of the 2019 season. But he is still currently sitting at 25 straight games without a 100-yard rushing outing. What to know for fantasy: Jones has been a top-15 running back in all five of his games this season, and after the Henry experience last weekend, the Texans are allowing the third-most points to fantasy running backs this season. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Green Bay has covered five consecutive games following a loss (3-0 ATS under coach Matt LaFleur). Read more.",60.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Which Todd Gurley will the Falcons get this weekend: the Week 5 version, when he had 121 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries against the Panthers, or the Week 6 version, when he averaged 2.4 yards per carry against the Vikings? The Lions are allowing 145 rushing yards per game (the fourth most in the NFL), which according to ESPN Stats & Information research is the team's most since allowing 172.1 when it went 0-16 in 2008. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: In a game between two teams that have spent most of the season losing fourth-quarter leads, both squads will end up doing it again, with wild swings during the final 15 minutes and a last-second, game-winning field goal. Would you expect anything less from Atlanta and Detroit? Their two most recent matchups ended with a 10-second runoff and then a delay of game penalty that allowed Matt Prater to take a second attempt at a field goal. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Lions running back D'Andre Swift has 6.9 yards per touch this season, best among rookie backs. He also leads the Lions with four touchdowns from scrimmage. What to know for fantasy: Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan is averaging 28 fantasy points per game this season when he has a fully healthy Julio Jones, up from 10.3 when his star wide receiver was hampered/inactive. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta is 5-10 ATS as a home favorite since the start of the 2018 season. Read more.",59.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Jets hope to have their full complement of wide receivers on the field for the first time, as rookie Denzel Mims is poised to make his NFL debut. Quarterback Sam Darnold is a question mark because of a shoulder injury. But if he starts, he will have plenty of speed on the outside with Mims and Breshad Perriman. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: The Bills won't call this a ""get right"" game, but I will. Not only does quarterback Josh Allen eclipse 320 passing yards, but Buffalo's defense will hold the Jets under 250 yards of total offense. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: The Jets' minus-110 point differential is the second worst in franchise history through six games of a season (minus-122 in 1976). The team's worst mark through seven games also came in '76, when New York was outscored by 142. Will Buffalo surpass 32 points in this one? What to know for fantasy: Allen was QB3 in Week 1 when these teams first met but is coming off his worst performance of the season on Monday night (QB17). See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: The Jets are 0-6 ATS this season. That's two short of the longest winless streak to start a season against the spread over the past 20 seasons. The 2003 Raiders failed to cover in each of their first eight games of the season. Read more.",35.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Browns were dominant in the first meeting between these teams, though they came away with only a five-point win. While the Bengals have improved since then, especially in run defense, the Browns still have the top rushing attack in the NFL, even without running back Nick Chubb. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: Cleveland defensive end Myles Garrett will sack Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow and force him to fumble for a second time this season, once again setting up a crucial late Browns touchdown. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. is averaging career lows in targets per game (6.7), catches per game (3.8), receiving yards (53.2), yards after the catch per reception (1.96) and percentage of routes targeted (23.5%). And his yards after the catch per reception ranks 86th out of 92 qualified wide receivers this season. What to know for fantasy: Cleveland running back Kareem Hunt is averaging 19 fantasy points in victories this season (including 24.1 in the Week 2 win over Cincinnati), way up from 9.9 in losses. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Cincinnati is 4-0 ATS in its past four games following a loss, dating back to last season. Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It will be all eyes on Washington's defensive line versus Dallas' offensive line. The Cowboys might have backups across the board, depending on guard Zack Martin's health. And Washington's strength remains its line, though after combining for seven sacks in the opener, this group has recorded only six in the past five weeks. Sunday is a chance for it to get healthy. And with Dallas likely paying close attention to edge rushers Montez Sweat and Chase Young, the interior could have a bigger day. -- John Keim Bold prediction: The Cowboys will intercept a Kyle Allen pass. He has been intercepted at least once in nine of his past 11 starts after not getting picked off in the first five starts of his career. So far this season, the Cowboys have one interception -- Chidobe Awuzie intercepted Jared Goff in the third quarter of the season opener. They have gone 158 pass attempts since without a pick. That has to change, and Allen has shown the tendency to throw it to the other team. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: Washington wide receiver Terry McLaurin has 56 targets this season, tied for fifth in the league. And he has accounted for 37% of Washington's receiving yards, the second-highest mark in the NFL after DeAndre Hopkins (40%). What to know for fantasy: Very quietly, Washington running back J.D. McKissic has improved his weekly positional rank each week this season and was the 12th-best running back in Week 6. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Since the start of the 2017 season, Dallas is 15-4 ATS against the NFC East. Read more.",31.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Who, exactly, will be playing offensive line for the Raiders, whose entire starting O-line is on the COVID-19 list after right tackle Trent Brown tested positive this week? If it's a bunch of backups, pity Raiders quarterback Derek Carr against Tampa Bay, which has the second-most sacks in the NFL with 22. Yeah, this has the makings of a familiar disaster for the Raiders -- think Super Bowl XXXVII. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: Tampa Bay running back Ronald Jones will have 100 yards rushing, and the offense as a whole will score four times. The Bucs have scored the second-most points in the NFL this season and face a Raiders defense that has given up 30 or more points in four of five games. With almost all of Tom Brady's receiving weapons returning to health -- most notably Chris Godwin -- these numbers aren't too much to ask from this group, although the Tampa Bay defense, like last weekend, will likely be the real difference-maker. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: The Buccaneers allow a league-low 282.0 yards per game, have the best pass-rush win rate (55%) in the NFL, blitz at the second-highest rate (41%) and give up the fewest rush yards per game (64.3). What to know for fantasy: Bucs wide receiver Mike Evans has a total of four catches and 14 yards in the three games in which Godwin has been active. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: The over is 5-0 in Las Vegas games this season. Read more.",67.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will the Broncos make rushing yards matter? The best, and perhaps only, defense against Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is keeping the ball away from him. The idea that you can pound away to win can be a tough sell, but the Chiefs have not defended the run well much of the season. They've allowed at least 144 rushing yards four times and over 180 yards twice -- but have lost just one of those games. Snow could be in the forecast, and the Broncos' best chance to win will be a run game paired with some play-action shots down the field. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: The Broncos will score multiple touchdowns. OK, that might not sound like a bold prediction, but they haven't scored even one in their past seven quarters against the Chiefs. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Mahomes has had multiple passing touchdowns in each of the first six games of the season, making him the first Chief in history to do so. What to know for fantasy: What will Chiefs running back Le'Veon Bell's impact be? Clyde Edwards-Helaire is RB16 on a per-game basis thus far, and if he loses 20% of his value to Bell, he'd fall to RB26. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Denver is 4-1 ATS as an underdog this season. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Patriots have turned the ball over seven times in their past two games, both losses. The 49ers have created just six takeaways all season. If the Patriots continue to be sloppy with the football, they could be looking at back-to-back regular-season home losses for the first time since the 2008 season. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: New England quarterback Cam Newton will rush for 90-plus yards. Believe it or not, Newton has only four such games in his career and hasn't hit the 90-yard mark since 2017. But the 49ers have struggled to contain mobile quarterbacks, allowing 231 rushing yards to QBs so far this season, most in the NFL. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo is averaging 7.4 yards per attempt this season (18th in the NFL), down from 8.4 in 2019 (third). What to know for fantasy: Is Julian Edelman overrated in fantasy? The most recent time the Pats wideout finished as a top-60 wide receiver was Week 2. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: New England is 41-16 ATS following a loss since the start of the 2003 season and is 52-27 ATS after a loss under coach Bill Belichick. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" What to watch for: It's Justin Herbert vs. Gardner Minshew -- if Minshew plays, that is. He might be benched in favor of Mike Glennon. Herbert recalled facing Minshew in college, when he was at Oregon and Minshew was under center for Washington State. It's an interesting battle of rookie QBs. Per research by the Elias Sports Bureau, Herbert needs 285 passing yards to have the fifth most in a player's first five career games. And Minshew is coming off five consecutive games with 40-plus pass attempts, the longest streak in Jaguars history. -- Shelley Smith Bold prediction: The Jaguars will tie an NFL record by allowing the Chargers to score 30-plus points. That would mark the sixth consecutive game in a single season in which they've allowed 30 points. The Chargers have scored 58 points in their past two games, and as Herbert gets more comfortable, he'll thrive against a Jaguars defense that struggles to rush the passer. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Jacksonville running back James Robinson has 569 yards and four touchdowns from scrimmage this season, both second among rookies (TDs is tied for second). What to know for fantasy: Dak Prescott was the only quarterback to outscore Herbert in Weeks 4-5 (the Chargers were on bye last weekend). See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Anthony Lynn is 5-14-1 ATS as a home favorite since becoming the Chargers' coach in 2017. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Cardinals linebacker Dennis Gardeck didn't have a sack last weekend after posting two in Week 5 in his defensive debut. Watch for him to be a consistent presence in the Cardinals' pass rush and get a sack of Seattle's Russell Wilson. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Something ridiculous will happen. It usually does when the Seahawks play at State Farm Stadium. There was the inexplicable 6-6 tie in 2016, the Thursday night game in 2017 in which the Legion of Boom came undone with injuries to Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor, and then the 2018 game in which Earl Thomas flipped the bird as he was carted off. Oh yeah, it's also where Malcolm Butler picked off Wilson to rip a second straight Super Bowl out of the Seahawks' hands. So what's next? How about Wilson leading another game-winning drive and hitting No. 3 tight end Jacob Hollister for the decisive touchdown? -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Wilson's 19 passing TDs are second most for a player through a team's first five games in NFL history. He needs three to tie the record for the most through a team's first six games (Peyton Manning, 22 in 2013). On the other side, Arizona QB Kyler Murray has five games this season with a passing TD and a rushing TD, the most by any player through the first six games of a season in NFL history. He would be the first player ever with six such games through a team's first seven games of a season. What to know for fantasy: Don't forget how much potential these Seattle wide receivers have. In each of the first three weeks this season, both DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett were top-20 performers at the position. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: The Cardinals are the only team to have every game go under this season. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Rams have defensive tackle Aaron Donald and the Bears have edge rusher Khalil Mack. So it should come as no surprise that these teams each boast a stout defense, with the Rams allowing an average of 19 points per game to the Bears' 19.3. However, the Rams have an edge on offense, scoring an average of four more points per game than the Bears. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Donald will sack Bears quarterback Nick Foles three times. The interior of the Bears' offensive line is suspect, especially after starting left guard James Daniels went on injured reserve with a torn pectoral muscle. Last weekend, Foles took some big hits because of faulty protection but managed to get rid of the football. The 31-year-old veteran quarterback will not be as lucky on Monday night versus Donald, who is the league's premier defensive lineman. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: This is the fifth time in the past 30 years that the Bears have started 5-1 or better (2012, 2006, 2001 and 1990). They made the playoffs in all but one of those seasons (2012). What to know for fantasy: Chicago running back David Montgomery has 11 catches in the two games following Tarik Cohen's injury. He had nine in four games with Cohen in the mix. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Chicago is 4-1 both straight up and ATS as an underdog this season. With another upset victory this weekend, Chicago could join the 2004 Jaguars and 1999 Lions as the only teams with five upset victories within their first seven games of a season in the Super Bowl era.

" What to watch for: How will Steelers' pass rush try to contain Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson's elusiveness? The Steelers have blitzed 46% of the time this season -- their highest rate since Mike Tomlin's first year as head coach (2007) -- and have a league-high 17 sacks when sending more than four rushers. But few can avoid pressure like Jackson, who is 10-1 since the start of 2019 when rushing for 70 or more yards. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: The Steelers will sack Jackson four times and hold him to under 50 rushing yards. In Jackson's lone outing against the Steelers last season, he was sacked five times and intercepted three. He did manage 70 rushing yards against the Steelers' defense, but this year, the Steelers are allowing just 68.8 rushing yards per game -- an improvement from last year's 109.6 mark. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: This marks the 25th meeting between Mike Tomlin and John Harbaugh, the most between two head coaches in the Super Bowl era (since 1966) and the third most in NFL history (regular season only), according to Elias Sports Bureau research. But it also marks the fifth matchup in NFL history between a 6-0 team (or better) and the reigning league MVP. Advantage Steelers, as the unbeaten team won three of the previous four such meetings. What to know for fantasy: Pittsburgh receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster saw 14 targets last weekend against the Titans, matching his combined total from his prior three games. His floor games have garnered attention, but he does have more than 16 points three times this season. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Pittsburgh is the seventh team in the Super Bowl era to get more than three points as an underdog with a 6-0 or better outright record. Each of the previous six lost outright and went 2-4 against the spread (ATS). Read more.",52.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The forecast for Sunday calls for winds gusting up to 40 mph in Green Bay. That's windy enough to impact more than just the kicking game -- and keep in mind that Packers kicker Mason Crosby is on the injury list this week. It could mess with even the strongest-armed quarterbacks, Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins. Rodgers might have inadvertently given Cousins a tip about judging the swirling winds at Lambeau -- or perhaps he was deceiving him -- when he said this week, ""You can't quite always rely on the flags in the stadium. They're kind of all over the place. So you learn which ones to look at and often it's opposite of the North end zone flag, that I've learned."" -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Packers receiver Davante Adams will go for 200 receiving yards on at least 14 catches. He torched the Vikings' secondary in Week 1 (156 yards and a pair of scores), but it'll be even worse this time around for Minnesota's cornerbacks, a group that has been decimated by injuries and could be down to Jeff Gladney, Harrison Hand and Kris Boyd to defend the top receiver in the NFC North. Adams has two games this season with at least 150 receiving yards and two touchdowns, and he'll record his third in Week 8. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Cousins has 10 interceptions this season, tied for the most in the NFL. And the Vikings' quarterback has three multi-interception games. The last Vikings QB with four in his first seven games of a season was Daunte Culpepper in 2005. What to know for fantasy: Through seven weeks, there have been four instances in which a receiver scored 40-plus points. Adams has accounted for two of them. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Green Bay is 3-0 ATS against Minnesota since the start of last season. Read more.",58.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa makes his first start and faces his first significant contact in 351 days. First up, Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald. Good luck, rookie. Ryan Fitzpatrick averaged 2.41 seconds time to throw, third best in the NFL, and that will be an important number for Tagovailoa to keep up against a strong Rams defense. How quick will Tagovailoa adjust his processing speed and quick decisions to the NFL game? If he doesn't do so Sunday, Donald and the Rams' defense could have a big day against a young Dolphins offensive line. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: Donald will tie his single-game career high of four sacks. The Rams' defense is hitting its stride and is eager to pursue Tagovailoa in his first career start. The Rams rank third in the NFL with 24 sacks this season, led by Donald's eight, so watch for them to feast on a Dolphins offense line that has a pass block win rate of 47.5% -- 30th in the league. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Los Angeles quarterback Jared Goff has a career-high 81% completion percentage outside the pocket this season, best in the NFL and more than 10% better than second place (69.25%). But in the pocket, his 65% rate is 24th in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Can Miami receiver DeVante Parker's fantasy efficiency sustain after the change under center? Since the beginning of last season, Parker's 1.95 points per target rank 15th best among 58 qualified receivers, ahead of high-end options such as Amari Cooper and Terry McLaurin. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Since the start of last season, QBs making their first career start are 11-4 ATS (2-1 ATS this season). Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: In three career games against the Patriots, Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen has completed just 48.4% of his passes, averaging just 192.6 passing yards per game with three touchdowns and five interceptions. Meanwhile, Bills coach Sean McDermott is winless in six tries against Bill Belichick. Look for both men to change their fortunes Sunday. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Punters Jake Bailey (Patriots) and Corey Bojorquez (Bills) will play defining roles in determining the final outcome. Temperatures in Western New York are expected to be in the 40s, with a chance of rain and wind gusts possibly exceeding 20 mph. So ballhandling and field position will be critical. Bailey has been excellent this season -- he's the AFC leader in net punting at 47.9 yards -- while Bojorquez has shown a powerful leg when the Bills are pinned deep (a long of 72 yards). -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: This is the Patriots' first three-game losing streak since 2002, when they lost four straight. And per Elias Sports Bureau research, this is the first time they are more than two games back in the division at any point in a season since 2000. To get back on track, they'll need a jump in performance from quarterback Cam Newton, who has a 15.3 Total QBR in his past three starts. What to know for fantasy: Who gets right? The Patriots have allowed a touchdown on 5.4% of their passes faced this season (below league average and way down from their league leading rate of 2.4% last season), but Allen is coming off a game against the Jets in which he threw 43 passes without a score. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: This is the first time New England has been an underdog in a division game since Week 2 of the 2015 season (at Buffalo). Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The best way for the Jets to stay competitive would seem to be forcing turnovers, which is one thing New York does well. They're eighth in forcing turnovers (10) and eighth in interceptions (7). But turning over the Chiefs is difficult. Kansas City has committed just five turnovers, fourth best in the league. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has thrown just one interception, and his 0.4% interception percentage is the best in the league. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: The Jets will move the ball between the 20s against the Chiefs, who are yielding a rather hefty 4.9 yards per rush, but they will take an oh-fer in the red zone. Let's call it 0-for-3. That is the Jets' Achilles' heel on offense, with a league-low 25% success rate in the red zone. So, no, there will be no stunning upset. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: The Jets have lost all seven of their games this season by more than seven points; the 1984 Oilers are the only team since the merger to start 0-8 with all eight losses going for more than seven points. Furthermore, New York has a minus-118 point differential this season, and a 20-point loss would mark the team's worst point differential through eight games in franchise history (minus-137 in 1976). What to know for fantasy: Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill has scored more than 15.5 fantasy points in six of seven games despite not yet having a 100-yard game (and four games under 65 yards). See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Reigning champions are just 2-8 ATS against teams that entered with 0-6 (or worse) outright records. And they've failed to cover each of the past seven times in that spot since 1978. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How will the Browns' offense respond minus star receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who is out for the season with a knee injury? Beckham leads the team in targets. Quarterback Baker Mayfield will have to find a connection elsewhere, as he now has 10 straight games with a TD pass, the second-longest streak of his career (17 games from 2018 to '19). -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: The Raiders, bolstered by the return of right tackle Trent Brown, will shut out the league's leading sack master in Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, who already has nine sacks and has had a sack in six straight games. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Cleveland running back Kareem Hunt has seven scrimmage touchdowns this season. The Browns are 5-0 when Hunt scores but 0-2 in games in which he fails to find the end zone. What to know for fantasy: Mayfield averaged 1.07 fantasy points per pass attempt in the big win over the Bengals, more than 2.5 times his season rate prior to the game. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: All six Raiders games this season have gone over the total. The longest over streak from the start of a season was the 2002 Saints, who started the season with nine consecutive overs. Read more.",54.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Lions have been much better against the run the past two weeks, holding Jacksonville and Atlanta under 100 rushing yards. For Detroit to win Sunday, it'll probably have to make it three straight, this time against rookie Jonathan Taylor, who has averaged over 4.0 yards per carry in each of his past four games. How the Lions handle that matchup could determine the game. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Colts receiver TY Hilton's string of not having at least 100 yards receiving will end at 17 games. Hilton, who is off to the slowest start of his nine-year career, hasn't had a 100-yard receiving game since he had 138 against the Giants on Dec. 23, 2018. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: Indianapolis quarterback Philip Rivers has a season-high three passing touchdowns against the Bengals before last week's bye, but he has not posted multiple passing scores in consecutive games since Weeks 13-14 of last season. And Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford is coming off his first 300-yard passing game of the season against the Falcons, but he has not passed for 300 yards or more in consecutive games since a three-game streak from Weeks 7-9 of 2019. What to know for fantasy: Lions running back D'Andre Swift has three scores over his past two games (two touchdowns this season prior) and is averaging 15 touches in those games (6.3 in prior games). See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Indianapolis is 11-3-1 ATS coming off of a bye week since the start of the 2005 season. Read more.",49.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: This game could feature a ton of points. The Bengals are ranked 21st in points allowed, while the Titans are tied for 16th. Cincinnati rookie quarterback Joe Burrow will have to protect the ball and make smart decisions against a Tennessee team ranked first in the NFL in total takeaways. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: The Titans' offense will start out on fire, especially in the passing game. Once they get a comfortable lead, they'll turn to running back Derrick Henry to close it out. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill will finish with 300 passing yards, Derrick Henry will rush for 150 yards and A.J. Brown will have 100 yards receiving. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Bengals are tied for the most sacks allowed this season with the Eagles (28), and their 34.3% pass rush win rate is the league's fourth worst. What to know for fantasy: Burrow has reached 300 passing yards in five of his past six starts, but should you worry about the Browns not being this week's opposition? In two games against Cleveland this season, Burrow has six touchdown passes. In his other five games, that total is just three. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: The over is 14-2 in the regular season in Tennessee games since Tannehill took over as the starting quarterback last season. Read more.",73.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert handle a variety of coverage looks from the Broncos, ranked 13th in the league in pass defense? There will be no blizzard this week in Denver, but the Broncos are coming off a snow-swept game in which the defense was the only unit that showed up, as it held the Chiefs to 286 total yards and no third-down conversions. Herbert has faced three top-10 pass defenses this season, and he completed 72% of his passes in those games with five touchdowns and all three of his interceptions. He has seven touchdown passes and no interceptions in his other two starts combined. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Look for Herbert to throw for 300-plus yards with receiver Mike Williams making a reemergence. Denver is shot, and the Chargers are hot ... sort of. No way Herbert goes into the Mile High City and doesn't take advantage of that thin air. Everyone is wondering whether Herbert can throw it over the mountain. -- Shelley Smith Stat to know: Broncos quarterback Drew Lock has a 19.9 Total QBR in the past two weeks, third worst among 32 qualified QBs and ahead of only Cam Newton (13.0) and Joe Flacco (11.6) over that span. What to know for fantasy: Herbert has seen his fantasy production spike in three straight and has 10 touchdown passes against one interception in those games (two touchdown passes and two interceptions prior). See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: The Chargers are 5-1 ATS this season, tied with Green Bay and Pittsburgh for the best cover percentage in the NFL. Read more.",48.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Wanna see a shootout? This matchup has all the makings of one. The Seahawks' top three running backs are all question marks due to injuries, which could force them to focus their game plan around MVP front-runner Russell Wilson and his receivers. Their defense has already allowed the most yards through six games in NFL history and could again be without safety Jamal Adams. That's a bad combination against an excellent playcaller in Kyle Shanahan. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Last week might have been National Tight Ends Day, but Sunday will be 49ers tight end George Kittle's day. Kittle will go for 150-plus yards and score at least once against a Seahawks defense that is struggling to stop everybody and has allowed an average of 14.8 yards per catch to tight ends, 31st in the league. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has the third-shortest average pass distance (6.5 air yards) and the fifth-worst interception rate (3.0%) since the start of last season, including playoffs. He's the only QB to rank in the bottom five in both categories. What to know for fantasy: Seahawks receiver Tyler Lockett is doing some historic things through seven weeks, but he has been held in check over his past seven meetings with the 49ers (8.1 fantasy points per game). See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: Seattle is 13-4 ATS against San Francisco since the start of the 2012 season. Read more.",65.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Bears seemed to be in shambles after Monday night's debacle in Los Angeles. All is lost, right? Not so fast. Looks can be deceiving, particularly when it pertains to the Bears. But since coach Matt Nagy took over in 2018, the Bears are 8-4 following a loss, and more importantly, 5-0 on short weeks. The Bears are often at their best when expectations are at their lowest. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Chicago quarterback Nick Foles will bounce back from Monday night's dud with at least one deep touchdown pass. The Saints have now allowed six passes of 48-plus yards in their past four games. But the Saints will see running backs Alvin Kamara and Latavius Murray combine for 150 rushing yards. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: The Saints' 78.7 offensive efficiency is sixth in the NFL, but their 23.2 defensive efficiency ranks 28th. No team has made the playoffs with a defensive efficiency below 30 since efficiency ratings began in 2006. What to know for fantasy: Kamara is looking to join Saquon Barkley, Todd Gurley II and DeMarco Murray as the only non-QBs since 2001 to open a season with 19.9 fantasy points in each of their teams' first seven games. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: New Orleans is 14-4 ATS on the road since the start of the 2018 season. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz has committed a league-high 12 turnovers this season. His 10 interceptions are tied with Kirk Cousins for the most in the NFL. That would seem to be good news for the Cowboys. The only issue? Dallas' defense has forced an NFL-low three takeaways. Something has to give. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Philadelphia running back Boston Scott will rush for more than 100 yards. He has just 113 on the season through seven games, but the Cowboys have allowed more than 200 yards rushing as a team in three of the past four games. They are allowing a league-worst 178.3 yards per game on the ground. Even with a banged-up offensive line, the Eagles will be able to get the job done with Scott on the ground. Miles Sanders hasn't practiced this week. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: Eagles receiver Travis Fulgham is the only NFL player with at least 350 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns over the past four weeks (third-most receiving yards in that span, behind only George Kittle and Robby Anderson). The Cowboys have allowed 12 receiving TDs to wide receivers this season, tied for the most league-wide. What to know for fantasy: Wentz has posted two of his top three career fantasy games over the past two weeks and now gets a Cowboys defense that has allowed not one, not two, but three quarterbacks to rack up north of 28 fantasy points against them this season. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: This is the first time Dallas has ever started 0-7 ATS, and it's one short of the longest winless streak to start a season against the spread over the past 20 seasons. Oakland in 2003 failed to cover in each of its first eight games of the season. The Cowboys will potentially have Ben DiNucci, a seventh-round rookie, under center as they try to cover for the first time this season. Read more.",45.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Watch how Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady attacks this Giants secondary. Brady and the Bucs are third in the NFL in averaging 31.7 points per game. They get to face a Giants defense that is in the bottom half of the league in pass defense (21st) despite facing four backup quarterbacks in their first seven games. This is a different kind of test. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Buccaneers linebacker Devin White will get double-digit tackles, pass-rusher Jason Pierre-Paul will get two sacks and the Bucs' defense will give up just one touchdown. Tampa Bay isn't overlooking this one, even against a one-win Giants squad, and its defense hasn't forgotten the 18-point lead it blew to New York quarterback Daniel Jones last year in a 32-31 loss at home. But this is a much different Bucs defense, and both White and Pierre-Paul were out because of injuries in that matchup last season. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: The Giants are the only NFL team to lose six of their first seven games in three of the past four seasons. They are guaranteed to start no better than 2-6 through eight games for the fourth straight season, and they would start 1-7 for the third time in the past four seasons with a loss. What to know for fantasy: Brady is looking for consecutive 30-point games for the first time since Weeks 2-3 of 2017, after producing his best game since Week 6 of 2009 (36.9 fantasy points) against the Raiders. See Week 8 rankings. Betting nugget: The Giants are 0-7 ATS as a home underdog since the start of last season. If you go back to the start of the 2018 season, New York is 1-12 ATS as a home underdog. Read more.",48.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This matchup is all about the Ravens' rushing attack and the Colts' run defense. The Ravens lead the NFL in rushing at 178.7 yards per game, while the Indianapolis D is the second stingiest in the league in that category at 79.9 yards per game. The Colts should have the advantage in this area on Sunday because they're heading into the game healthy on the defense, whereas the Ravens will be without starting left tackle Ronnie Stanley (ankle). -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: J.K. Dobbins will become the first Ravens running back in two years to gain over 100 yards rushing in back-to-back games. The Colts are the NFL's No. 2 run defense, but Dobbins rushed for a career-high 113 yards on Sunday against the Steelers -- who had the top-ranked run defense at the time. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: The Colts are one of five unbeaten teams at home this season (3-0). But the Ravens are one of three squads that haven't lost on the road (3-0). What to know for fantasy: Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has four games this season with fewer than 18 fantasy points, after having just one such game last season. That's a tough trend to take into a matchup with the top defense thus far in terms of limiting QB points. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Indianapolis is 0-3 against the spread (ATS) as a home underdog under coach Frank Reich. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Seahawks are allowing 358.7 passing yards per game; no team has ever allowed even 300 passing yards per game over the course of a full season. It could be a get-right game for the Bills' passing attack, which has averaged just 210.5 yards over its past four games after averaging 316.3 in the first four weeks of the season. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Seattle safety Jamal Adams will get two sacks. The All-Pro's return from a four-game absence comes one week after the Seahawks executed one of the most blitz-heavy game plans in 11 seasons under Pete Carroll, something they had to do without the ability to get pressure with their front four. The addition of Carlos Dunlap to the Seahawks' defensive line would ideally make them less reliant on blitzing, but expect that to still be a big part of their defensive approach now that Adams is back in the lineup. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Seahawks wide receivers DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett are the first pair in NFL history with 500 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns each in their team's first seven games. What to know for fantasy: Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson is pacing toward a season with 4,900 passing yards and nearly 600 rushing yards. There has only been one instance in which a quarterback threw for 4,500 yards and ran for 400 in NFL history: Daunte Culpepper in 2004. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: The Bills have failed to cover in four straight games. Read more.",61.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Panthers find a strategy to keep the game close? If the Chiefs score points like they have recently -- they're averaging 39 over their past two games -- Carolina won't be able to keep up. Whether it's to run the ball consistently to chew up the clock or find a defensive scheme to frustrate quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Panthers have to figure out a plan that works, something the Chiefs' past two opponents, both also under .500, couldn't do. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey will have 150 total yards from scrimmage after missing six games with a high ankle sprain. He returns against the league's 29th-ranked run defense (142.8 yards per game), and his performance will help keep Mahomes off the field with sustained drives. -- David Newton Stat to know: Mahomes has 21 touchdown passes and one interception this season. That's the highest touchdown pass count with no more than one pick through a player's first eight games of a season in NFL history, per the Elias Sports Bureau. What to know for fantasy: Touching the ball is the best way to accrue fantasy points, making Curtis Samuel a free-agent bargain, given that he ranks eighth among wide receivers with 6.9 touches per game. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Carolina quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is 20-4 ATS in his career as an underdog, including the playoffs. Read more.",56.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Who plays left cornerback for Tennessee? Adoree' Jackson missed practice on Thursday and is yet to be added to the 53-man roster after spending most of the season on the injured reserve list. If Jackson is activated, it's not likely that he'll see a high volume of snaps, so someone will have to rotate in. The Titans released veteran Johnathan Joseph, leaving Tye Smith and Breon Borders as possibilities on the left side. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Bears quarterback Nick Foles will be sacked a minimum of four times. Chicago could be without four Week 1 starters along the offensive line against the Titans -- and the best-case scenario still leaves it down two of them. Foles has been under tremendous pressure since he took over for Mitchell Trubisky in Week 3, as the Bears have surrendered 20 sacks (tied for ninth most in the NFL) and rank 21st in pass block win rate, according to ESPN Stats & Information data. Foles is in for a long afternoon. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Tennessee is last in the NFL in opponent third-down conversion rate allowed at 61.9%. The team was eighth last season at 36.3%. But luckily for the Titans, the Bears' offense ranks 31st in third-down conversion rate at 34.9%, meaning third down could be interesting on Sunday. What to know for fantasy: Titans running back Derrick Henry has five straight games with at least 15 fantasy points but three or fewer receptions. That's the longest streak of its kind since one by Arian Foster in 2012, and it might continue against a Bears defense that is worse against the run than you might think (below league average in both running back rushing yards and yards per carry). See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: When Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill starts regular-season games for Tennessee, overs are 15-2, including 6-1 this season. Read more.",36.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Who's going to suit up at quarterback for the Lions after Matthew Stafford was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list on Tuesday? While coach Matt Patricia would not speculate about the QB's status, it's possible Stafford plays in Week 9 if he continues to test negative every day this week. If not, it'll be Chase Daniel or David Blough under center. Since Stafford was drafted by Detroit in 2009, the Lions are 5-22 (.185) when he doesn't start, including 0-8 last season. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Vikings QB Kirk Cousins continues his dominance over Patricia's Lions with a 275-yard, three-touchdown day in which he completes 75% of his passes. Last year, Cousins threw for 580 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions against Detroit, and he has yet to have a game under 70% completions against the Lions since Patricia took over in 2018. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: This will be running back Adrian Peterson's third career game against Minnesota, a team he spent 10 seasons with earlier in his career. Peterson's teams are 0-2 against his former club. What to know for fantasy: Lions wideout Kenny Golladay will not be active this week, so it's worth noting that Marvin Jones Jr. averages 22.2 points per game during his Lions career when seeing at least 10 targets. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Minnesota has covered each of the past five meetings between these teams. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Falcons' secondary is improving, thanks in part to a pass rush that has generated 20 of its 47 QB hits and six of its 13 sacks over the past three games. And Broncos QB Drew Lock is completing an NFL-worst 58% of his passes and has the fifth-highest off-target percentage in the league, per ESPN Stats & Information. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: The Broncos will rush for at least 140 yards, even after coach Vic Fangio was asked repeatedly about letting Lock throw more this week after the team scored 21 points in the fourth quarter while in up-tempo, chuck-it-around mode in Sunday's win over the Chargers. The Broncos need to keep the ball to beat Atlanta. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan has a 72.3% completion rate and 89.3 Total QBR with wide receiver Julio Jones on the field this season, but Ryan's numbers fall to 59.1% completions and 45.1 Total QBR without him. Jones leads all NFL players with 123.7 receiving yards per game over his past three contests. What to know for fantasy: Denver rookie wideout Jerry Jeudy led the NFL with 159 air yards last week but scored just 11.3 fantasy points in the process. For reference, the other 12 players with at least 100 air yards last week averaged 21.6 fantasy points. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta is 0-4 outright at home and as a favorite this season. Atlanta is also 2-7 outright as a favorite since the start of last season. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will Washington handle Giants QB Daniel Jones? Jones is 3-0 against Washington and 1-16 against everyone else. He has thrown seven touchdowns with three picks and owns a 75.0 total QBR in those three games -- his best showing versus any NFC East team. Washington has sacked Jones just twice, and in Week 6, he threw for only 112 yards but ran for 74. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Giants RB Wayne Gallman will run for over 100 yards, making him New York's first 100-yard rusher this season. No team is better at defending the pass than Washington. It is allowing just 185.9 yards per game. So how do you attack it? Run the ball! The Giants have rushed more effectively in recent weeks. That will continue on Sunday against Washington, with New York's best individual effort this season. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: Washington is averaging 292.7 yards of offense per game this season, the third fewest in the NFL (Jets at 259.0, Giants at 291.8). And the team also has the second-worst QBR this season at 41.0. What to know for fantasy: New York wide receiver Sterling Shepard has gone over 15 fantasy points in both of his games back from injury, and he averaged 18.3 against Washington a season ago. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: The Giants have covered seven straight and 16 out of 20 on the road since 2018. Read more.",39.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Don't be surprised to see the Texans blitz more than they already do, even with outside linebacker Whitney Mercilus out. The Texans blitz an average of 12 times per game, per ESPN Stats and Information. On Sunday, they'll be facing rookie quarterback Jake Luton, a sixth-round pick who hasn't taken a game snap since Nov. 23, 2019, when Oregon State played Washington State. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: Houston RB David Johnson will run for more than 100 yards for the first time this season. When these two teams played in Week 5, Johnson ran for 96 yards on 17 carries. And the Jaguars rank 28th in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: Luton had 28 passing TDs and three interceptions last season at Oregon State. That 9.3 ratio ranked fifth in the FBS behind only Justin Fields, Tua Tagovailoa, Joe Burrow and Dustin Crum. What to know for fantasy: Houston wideout Brandin Cooks is very quietly one of just three wide receivers with at least seven catches in each of his past three games. On a per-game basis, he is WR5 over that stretch (21.6 fantasy points per game). See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: These two teams are a combined 3-12 ATS this season. Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: This is always a battle, but the matchup brings a little extra this year: rookie QB Justin Herbert vs. seven-year vet Derek Carr, who has been putting up impressive numbers. Both offensive lines are in flux, but each unit should be back at full strength or close to it on Sunday. But the Chargers will miss defensive end Joey Bosa, which should make Carr feel a little more comfortable in the pocket. -- Shelley Smith Bold prediction: The patchwork Raiders offensive line will throw a shutout against the Chargers' hobbled pass rush, a week after shutting out an obviously hobbled Myles Garrett in frigid Cleveland. And Carr, able to extend plays, will rush for at least one first down. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: The Raiders are 3-1 on the road this season after going a combined 3-13 on the road in the previous two seasons. And they will seek to win three straight road games for just the third time in the past 15 seasons. What to know for fantasy: Herbert has four straight games with at least 21 fantasy points, tying Deshaun Watson for the longest such streak by a rookie quarterback among active players. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Six of seven Raiders games have gone over the total this season. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Despite the Cardinals playing well as of late, they'll be down Byron Murphy Jr., and maybe Dre Kirkpatrick, at cornerback. If Kirkpatrick is out too, watch for Miami rookie QB Tua Tagovailoa to have a big outing, because whomever Arizona cornerback Patrick Peterson isn't guarding will be picked on all day. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: The Dolphins will hold Cardinals wideout DeAndre Hopkins to under 50 receiving yards. In games during which both Xavien Howard and Byron Jones are healthy, the Dolphins are allowing just 5.5 yards per attempt and 13.8 points per game. They have the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense, and a big reason is their big-money cornerbacks. This is a marquee prove-it game for the Dolphins' defense, though, and neutralizing Hopkins -- who is currently averaging more than 100 receiving yards per game -- would be a big accomplishment. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: Tagovailoa and Kyler Murray finished 1-2 in the 2018 Heisman Trophy voting. This will be only the fifth time that quarterbacks who finished 1-2 in the Heisman in the same year have started against each other in the NFL. (Lamar Jackson and Deshaun Watson are the most recent pair to meet, earlier this season.) What to know for fantasy: Hopkins has been a top-10 wide receiver in five of seven games this season, and he faces a Dolphins defense that ranks 21st this season against fantasy wide receivers. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami has covered games by 11.5 points per contest this season, which is on pace to be the best mark in the Super Bowl era. (The current record is 11.1, by the Oakland Raiders in 1967.) Read more.",49.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Cowboys have had more than 25,000 fans in each of their past three games at AT&T Stadium, and a similar crowd is expected Sunday. How many of them will be Steelers fans? The Cowboys will be starting their fourth different quarterback against a ferocious pass rush. And Pittsburgh has a balanced offense that has scored at least 26 points in each game. When the Steelers visited in 2012, AT&T Stadium was overrun by Terrible Towels among the crowd of 95,595. The crowd will be smaller on Sunday, but the percentage of Steelers fans could be higher. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott will have his first 100-yard game. The Steelers struggled to stop the Ravens on the ground last week, giving up 265 yards -- including 113 to rookie J.K. Dobbins. And they will likely be without defensive lineman Tyson Alualu, linebacker Devin Bush and defensive back Mike Hilton in their run defense. Still, Pittsburgh has had its fair share of tough tests on the ground, and it's not getting any easier this week, as the Cowboys will likely lean on their rush attack with the quarterback situation in flux. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: The Steelers are forcing 1.9 turnovers per game, tied for the second most in the NFL behind the Seahawks (2.0). The Cowboys, meanwhile, are committing a league-high 2.3 turnovers per game. What to know for fantasy: Elliott is averaging 8.8 fantasy points per game in the three weeks following the Dak Prescott injury (RB25). He was RB4 in the five weeks prior, averaging 22.3 points in the process. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Dallas has failed to cover games by an average of 10.1 points per contest this season. That's on pace to be the second-worst mark in the Super Bowl era. (The Baltimore Colts were at minus-10.7 in 1981.) Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Wide receiver Antonio Brown will make his debut with the Buccaneers, who look to avenge a Week 1 loss at New Orleans and maintain hold of the NFC South. Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said they're ""light-years"" from where they were in Week 1 as an offense, and Todd Bowles' defense has become one of the league's best. But that D has shown some vulnerability over the past two weeks against the Raiders and Giants, having to overcome slow starts and rely on second-half interceptions to be the difference-makers. It'll need a much faster start against Drew Brees. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: Bucs quarterback Tom Brady will burn the Saints with a 50-yard TD pass. OK, this one actually isn't so bold, since the Saints have allowed an astounding seven passes of 48-plus yards over their past five games. New Orleans' secondary has made gradual improvements, but who better to find and expose a breakdown in coverage than Brady -- especially now that he has so many diverse playmakers to work with in Mike Evans, Rob Gronkowski, Brown and possibly Chris Godwin (if he is healthy)? -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Saints running back Alvin Kamara has six straight games with 100 scrimmage yards, the longest active streak in the NFL and the longest streak by a Saints player since Deuce McAllister's team-record nine-game streak in 2003. Kamara's 27 career games of 100 scrimmage yards are tied with Joe Horn for third in franchise history. What to know for fantasy: In his past three matchups with the Saints, Evans has just five catches on his 119 routes run. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: All seven New Orleans games have gone over the total this season. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Patriots have lost four straight. The Jets have lost eight straight. Each team has gone three straight without a touchdown pass. Both quarterbacks, Cam Newton and Sam Darnold, are struggling. Once upon a time -- say, 10 years ago -- this was a fun rivalry. Then it became one-sided. Now it looks no-sided. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: Rookie Patriots linebacker Josh Uche, who played 13 snaps in his debut, will take on a larger role and get involved in creating a turnover that helps the Patriots to a victory. Uche, a second-round pick from Michigan, is the type of fast, physical linebacker the Patriots desperately need to become a centerpiece of their defense. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: Over his past three games, Newton has zero touchdowns, five interceptions, a 21% off-target percentage and a 25.3 Total QBR. Part of the problem might be his wideouts. That group has one receiving TD this season (fewest in the NFL), and the Pats have thrown eight picks when targeting a wide receiver (one fewer than the most in the NFL). What to know for fantasy: Is New England running back Damien Harris getting enough attention? His per-game average would have him trending toward an 1,100-yard season, and he finally got into the end zone last week in Buffalo. His role is game-script dependent, but even the struggling Patriots are 7.5-point road favorites over the Jets. See Week 9 rankings. Betting nugget: Bill Belichick is 6-1 ATS in his career in New England when facing a team 0-3 or worse outright. Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Keep an eye on the protection for Carolina quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. He was sacked five times and pressured 15 times in a Week 2 loss to the Bucs. He threw two interceptions, and the Panthers' offense never got into a rhythm. But when Bridgewater has been kept relatively clean, he has played well. -- David Newton Bold prediction: After being kept out of the end zone for the first time this season in a 38-3 loss to the Saints last Sunday night, Tom Brady and the Bucs rebound with a five-touchdown performance. Coming off their two previous losses earlier this season (Saints in Week 1 and Bears in Week 5), the Bucs combined for 69 points (nine touchdowns) in Week 2 and Week 6. One of those games came against the Panthers, who are still struggling to get off the field on third down and can't get to the quarterback. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: The Buccaneers are allowing just 77.9 rushing yards per game and 3.3 yards per rush this season, both the best in the NFL. And the Panthers will be without starting running back Christian McCaffrey. What to know for fantasy: Brady struggled all night long in Week 9 on his way to 2.4 fantasy points. But in the games immediately following his past four single-digit performances, the future Hall of Famer has averaged 21.3 fantasy points. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Brady is 19-6 against the spread (ATS) in his career after a loss, with 17 covers in his past 20 such games. And he's 7-1 ATS coming off a 20-plus-point loss. However, Bridgewater is 21-4 ATS in his career as an underdog, including five straight covers as an underdog this season. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Packers don't lose to teams like this often. They're 14-3 in games against teams with a winning percentage of .125 or worse with Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. And Rodgers is 15-2 in his career as at least a 12-point favorite. The only two losses came in 2018 to Arizona as a 13.5-point favorite and in 2011 at Kansas City as a 13-point favorite. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Jacksonville QB Jake Luton will be sacked at least four times on Sunday. The Packers don't blitz a lot -- they rank 25th in that area -- but is there a better time to break tendencies than when facing a rookie QB making just his second start? Luton completed just four of 13 passes and threw an interception when he was under pressure in his debut against Houston, and while the Packers have blitzed 69 times this season, they have picked up five of their 17 sacks when doing so. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: Per Elias Sports Bureau data, Green Bay receiver Davante Adams joined Calvin Johnson (2012) as the only players in NFL history with three games of at least 10 receptions, 150 receiving yards and a receiving TD in a season  -- and Adams has played only six games this year. What to know for fantasy: Jaguars running back James Robinson has six games with more than 14.5 fantasy points this season. The only running backs with more such games are a pair of guys you've likely heard of: Alvin Kamara (eight) and Dalvin Cook (seven). See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Jacksonville is 1-5 ATS in games that follow a loss this season. And Green Bay is 5-1 ATS against teams with losing records. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Cleveland running back Nick Chubb, who has been out since Week 4 with a knee injury, is expected to return Sunday. The Browns were leading the NFL in rushing when Chubb was healthy, and they will look to get rolling on the ground once again. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: Regardless of who starts at running back for the Browns, the team will rush for more than 175 yards. Before Chubb injured his knee on Oct. 4, Cleveland led the league in rushing, but it has ranked 24th since then with 96 rushing yards per game. Chubb could be activated from injured reserve in time to play the Texans on Sunday, and a date against the last-place rushing defense (Houston is allowing an average of 159.5 rushing yards per game) could be the ticket to get the Browns' running game back on track. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson has six straight games with multiple passing touchdowns, the second-longest active streak in the NFL after Seattle's Russell Wilson (nine). What to know for fantasy: Texans receiver Will Fuller V's 2.43 fantasy points per target rank second among qualified receivers, right on the heels of DK Metcalf's 2.46. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Houston is 0-5 ATS as an underdog and 0-4 ATS on the road this season. Overall, the Texans' 1-7 ATS mark is tied with the Jets for the second-worst ATS mark. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Giants should have won the first matchup, but this might be a different Eagles offense they're facing several weeks later. Middle linebacker Blake Martinez even conceded that. The Eagles could have right tackle Lane Johnson, guard Isaac Seumalo, running back Miles Sanders, tight end Dallas Goedert and wide receivers Alshon Jeffery and Jalen Reagor playing this time around, and that should make a noticeable difference. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz will account for four touchdowns. With the Eagles coming off a bye, he has had a chance to take a step back and recalibrate following a rocky first half. He'll quiet the voices calling for Jalen Hurts, as well as the ones wistful for Nick Foles (hello, Brett Favre), by taking it to the Giants' defense, which is ranked 25th against the pass. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Giants QB Daniel Jones has lost 16 straight games against all opponents not named Washington. Part of the problem is obviously turnovers. Jones has 36 since the start of last season, the most in the NFL, and he has had at least one in 20 of 22 career games played. But Wentz has a turnover in eight straight games, the longest active streak in the NFL. Both QBs rank in the top three in interceptions this season (Wentz is No. 1 with 12, Jones third with nine). What to know for fantasy: The Eagles' Travis Fulgham has been a top-15 fantasy receiver in three of his past four games, and the Giants are the 10th most susceptible defense in terms of WR scoring this season. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: The over is 23-10-2 in Philadelphia road games since the start of the 2016 season. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Alex Smith is again a starting NFL quarterback. He is expected to start for Washington on Sunday for the first time since he broke his right leg on Nov. 18, 2018. Smith's journey is one that Lions players have heavily respected. Linebacker Reggie Ragland, Smith's former teammate in Kansas City, said despite COVID-19 protocols, he's going to give Smith a hug, while running back Kerryon Johnson called Smith's return ""absolutely tremendous. It is admirable."" -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Washington running back Antonio Gibson will crack 100 yards for the second time this season, but it won't be enough. Detroit QB Matthew Stafford will throw two touchdown passes and drop Washington to 0-4 against quarterbacks ranked in the top 18 for Total QBR this season. -- John Keim Stat to know: Washington has lost five straight road games going back to 2019, and it has averaged 17 points per game in those five losses. But the Lions are 2-9 at home since the start of the 2019 season, the worst record at home in the NFL over that span. They are one of two teams still seeking their first home win this season (Jets). What to know for fantasy: Washington running back J.D. McKissic has been a top-27 running back in three of his past four games and accounted for one-third of Smith's completions in Week 9. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Detroit is 2-9 ATS since the start of last season in the month of November or later, and it has failed to cover at home this season (0-3 ATS). Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will the Bills handle Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray's running ability? Buffalo is allowing an average of 4.6 yards per carry, and Murray is averaging 7.1. He's coming off the first 100-yard rushing game of his career, and if he can pick up against Buffalo where he left off last week, the Bills will have to figure out who to focus on defensively: Murray or the likes of DeAndre Hopkins, Larry Fitzgerald and Christian Kirk in the passing game. How the Bills decide to attack Arizona's offense will dictate how the matchup goes. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Arizona will total fewer than 350 yards of offense for just the second time this season, as a healing Bills defense continues to round into its 2019 form. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: The Cardinals rank second in pass block win rate this season, while the Bills rank fourth in pass rush win rate (via ESPN metrics powered by NFL Next Gen Stats). What to know for fantasy: Murray is one of three players over the past four weeks with 225 rushing yards and three rushing scores. Dalvin Cook and Derrick Henry are the others. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Buffalo is 1-4 ATS both over its past five games overall and in its past five road games. Read more.",60.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Buckle up for the first head-to-head matchup between the first two wideouts -- and former college teammates at Alabama -- taken in the historically deep 2020 NFL draft receiver class. The Raiders' Henry Ruggs III, taken 12th overall, has been hot and cold for Las Vegas with just 10 catches but a 22.0 yards-per-catch average. And Jerry Jeudy, the No. 15 overall pick, leads Denver with 484 receiving yards on 30 receptions with two scores. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: The Broncos will have two rushing touchdowns. Why? Because almost everybody has had two rushing touchdowns against the Raiders this season. Six of their eight opponents, including both of their previous home opponents, have had exactly two rushing touchdowns. The Broncos have just seven rushing TDs over their first eight games, with only one of those coming from RB Phillip Lindsay. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has the third-best TD-to-INT ratio this season (8.0). He has thrown 16 touchdowns to two interceptions. What to know for fantasy: Jeudy scored more points last week than in his prior three games combined, and now he faces a Raiders defense that has allowed not one, not two, not three, but four receivers to score north of 22 points. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: The over is 7-1 in Las Vegas games this season, tied with New Orleans for the highest over percentage this season. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: It's Tua Tagovailoa (No. 5 pick in 2020 draft) vs. Justin Herbert (No. 6), and though both players may say the right things this week, it's in a competitor's nature to want to outduel one of the other top QBs in his class. Herbert got a head start, beginning his career in Week 2 and throwing for 17 TDs to just five interceptions. But Tagovailoa heads into his third start with the advantage in wins (2-0 vs. 1-6), and he's coming off a tantalizing performance against Kyler Murray's Cardinals. Quite a duel. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: Chargers outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu will have 1-2 sacks and 3-4 hurries. With defensive end Joey Bosa out, the Chargers' defense will have to find a way to get pressure without its best defender. Nwosu has been ready for a bigger role for some time now. -- Shelley Smith Stat to know: All six of the Chargers' losses this season have been one-score games, tied for the most such losses within a team's first eight games in NFL history, per Elias Sports Bureau data (1944 Brooklyn Tigers, 1983 Buccaneers and 2015 Ravens). What to know for fantasy: Since making his debut in Week 2, Herbert ranks as QB4 on a per-game basis (24.3). He is in the top 10 at the position in rushing yards, passing yards and fantasy points per pass attempt. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami has covered in four consecutive games, is 4-1 ATS as a home favorite since the start of the 2018 season and is 15-5 ATS since its Week 5 bye last season -- the best mark in the league. Read more.",50.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Seahawks' offense ranks among the best in the league and leads the NFL in scoring, averaging 34.3 points per game. However, the Rams' defense is stout under first-year coordinator Brandon Staley and is allowing an average of 19 points per game, second best in the league. The Seahawks' offense will be the Rams' greatest test since they fell in Week 3 to the Bills, who also defeated the Seahawks, in Week 9. Watch for defensive tackle Aaron Donald to try to disrupt QB Russell Wilson, whom he has sacked 12 times in his career, more than any other quarterback. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Donald and Seahawks safety Jamal Adams will combine for at least four sacks. The Seahawks have been the NFL's most blitz-heavy team over the past two weeks as they try to help a pass defense that's getting gashed at a historic rate. And Donald is tied for the NFL lead in sacks with nine and could be facing a backup center Sunday if Ethan Pocic's concussion keeps him from playing. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: The Rams have allowed the fewest completions on throws 20-plus yards downfield this season (5-of-23) and are the only team that has yet to allow a passing TD on such a play. But Wilson has seven touchdowns on those throws this season (tied for second in the NFL). What to know for fantasy: Over the past two seasons, Rams QB Jared Goff is averaging 331.8 passing yards in his four meetings with the Seahawks, and Seattle isn't stopping anyone right now. Week 9 marked the third time this season that a QB scored more than 34 fantasy points against them. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Since drafting Wilson in 2012, Seattle is 23-10-2 ATS as an underdog, the best mark in the NFL over that span. Read more.",54.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Saints have emerged as one of the NFL's hottest teams. But they need to avoid a letdown against a 49ers team that has been decimated by injuries. San Francisco's thrilling 48-46 win in the Superdome last season should provide added motivation. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: Saints receiver Michael Thomas will deliver his first big game of the season, going for 110-plus yards and at least one touchdown. In last year's meeting with San Francisco, he posted 11 catches for 134 yards and a touchdown. Opposing offenses have been moving their top receivers around to get them matched up against Niners cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, who is allowing a 109.9 passer rating against when he's the nearest defender. If Moseley is still starting this week, it wouldn't be a surprise if Saints coach Sean Payton does the same with Thomas. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: The 49ers are looking to avoid their first three-game losing streak since Weeks 10-13 of 2018. They have a 22-8 record with Jimmy Garoppolo (IR, ankle) as the starting QB since 2017, but they are just 5-22 with anyone else in that span. What to know for fantasy: Since Week 5, the 49ers are a bottom-10 defense in opponent completion percentage (67.9%). And Saints QB Drew Brees has completed 78.9% of his passes over his past three games. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Since the start of last season, San Francisco is 9-3 ATS on the road, the third-best mark in the NFL over that span, and 6-1 ATS as a road underdog (second best). Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: All eyes will be on Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger this weekend. He is eligible to come off the reserve/COVID-19 list on Saturday, and the Steelers are preparing as though he'll play. If he does indeed take the field on Sunday, then he'll be doing so with only one team walk-through and on two knees that were sore after a hit against the Cowboys. He should feel comforted that the Bengals have only 11 sacks this season and traded one of their biggest defensive anchors in Carlos Dunlap. Without Roethlisberger, the Steelers could start either Mason Rudolph or Joshua Dobbs. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: The Bengals will have fewer than 225 total yards. Cincinnati has been rolling recently behind rookie quarterback Joe Burrow, but against a quality defense, he could have one of the toughest games of his young career. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: The Steelers lead the NFL with 32 sacks and rank second in pass rush win rate this season, while the Bengals have allowed 28 sacks -- tied for the second most in the NFL -- and rank 27th in pass block win rate (win rates via ESPN metrics and NFL Next Gen Stats). What to know for fantasy: Big Ben has failed to get to 15.5 fantasy points in each of his past three divisional games. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past 10 seasons, Cincinnati is 31-16-2 ATS as a road underdog, the second-best cover percentage in the NFL in that situation over that span. Underdogs in general are 15-6-2 ATS in AFC North games since 2018. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Can the Patriots play their second straight turnover-free game? That is their best chance to spring the upset. The Patriots have a minus-1 turnover differential on the season (tied for 18th), while the Ravens are plus-4 (tied for sixth). -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: The Ravens will score over 40 points for the first time this season. During Baltimore's 10-game road win streak, quarterback Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore offense have averaged more points (32.3) than anyone else away from home. New England, which gave up 37 points last season to the Ravens, has a banged-up defense working on a short week. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: The Patriots have failed to throw a passing touchdown in four straight games. A fifth straight game would match the second-longest streak in franchise history (1983 and 1988), and the franchise record of six games was set in 1972. One target to watch for the Pats' efforts to break the streak is wide receiver Jakobi Meyers, who had career highs in receiving yards (169), receptions (12), targets (14) and receiving first downs (8) in the Patriots' win over the Jets on Monday. What to know for fantasy: Jackson has scored 40.7% of his fantasy points this season with his legs, a rate that isn't much different from last season (40%). The deep ball has been the fantasy-scoring problem, as his points per deep attempt is down 36.3% this season. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: The Patriots have been a home underdog just three times in the past 15 seasons, winning each game outright. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Bears coach Matt Nagy is under tremendous pressure to fix the league's worst offense, but he is 4-0 versus the Vikings since he took over in 2018 and 2-1 on Monday Night Football. For Nagy's steak against Minnesota to continue, Chicago's offense needs a wake-up call. The Bears average an abysmal 19.8 points and 82.6 rushing yards per game, and they rank 31st in third-down conversion (32.3%) and yards per play (4.81). On the flip side, the Vikings have allowed opponents to score 30-plus points on three separate occasions in 2020. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Vikings running back Dalvin Cook is going to face a ton of loaded boxes, so it's possible the Vikings will have to get into a dropback game with quarterback Kirk Cousins to win this one. The Bears' defense knows how to exploit Minnesota's weaknesses and will do so by sacking Cousins five times and not allowing him to complete a pass over 6 yards downfield. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Cousins is 0-9 in his career on Monday Night Football, the most consecutive losses by a starting QB to begin a career on MNF and the longest losing streak by a starting QB in MNF history. What to know for fantasy: The Saints' Drew Brees and Alvin Kamara have been great, right? Over the past two weeks, they've racked up 83.5 points between them. Well, over that stretch, Cook has 87.8 points -- by himself. See Week 10 rankings. Betting nugget: All five NFC North divisional games have gone over the total this season, after they were 9-3 to the under last season. Read more.",37.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Can the Ravens' run defense stop Titans running back Derrick Henry? Henry ran for 195 yards against Baltimore in the playoffs last season and will face a rush defense that probably won't have nose tackle Brandon Williams. In the Ravens' past seven games without Williams, they have allowed an average of 165.1 yards rushing. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Henry will run for more than 150 yards and score two touchdowns. The Titans know what it takes to get into a rhythm: giving Henry the football. This is one of those times when they have to rely on Henry to set the tone and carry the team to a much-needed victory. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson is completing just 38.8% of his passes thrown 15-plus yards downfield this season, 26th out of 33 qualified quarterbacks in the NFL. Last weekend against New England, Jackson was 1-for-6 (18 yards) on such throws. What to know for fantasy: The Titans have failed to score more than 20 points in three of wide receiver A.J. Brown's seven games this season. In those instances, Brown has yet to top 40 yards and is averaging just 8.1 fantasy points per game. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: When quarterback Ryan Tannehill starts regular-season games for Tennessee, overs are 16-3, including 7-2 this season. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Taysom Hill will reportedly make his debut as a starting QB in the NFL with Drew Brees sidelined by broken ribs and a punctured lung. The Saints' choice of Hill is certainly surprising, considering fellow backup Jameis Winston played most of the second half last week and has far more experience. But the Saints and coach Sean Payton have never made it any secret about their belief that Hill could be a successful NFL quarterback despite the fact that he is a run-first player who has attempted only 20 career passes, including the playoffs. That makes this one of the NFL's most fascinating matchups of the week, as New Orleans tries to keep its six-game win streak alive against its biggest rival. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: Hill will not just throw his first career NFL touchdown on Sunday -- he'll throw multiple TD passes. Hill, who has been used mainly in run situations, has attempted only 18 passes in his NFL career. But Payton will call plays to show that Hill can be effective with his arm, too. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: The Falcons are 3-1 under interim coach Raheem Morris after an 0-5 start under Dan Quinn. They have the third-best offensive efficiency (78.8) in the NFL since Week 6, trailing only the Chiefs (89.8) and Buccaneers (79.0). In those first five weeks, they were 21st (59.2). What to know for fantasy: Atlanta QB Matt Ryan will look to establish some fantasy consistency with a healthy roster. This season, Ryan has as many finishes as a top-eight quarterback as he does weeks outside the top 20 (three apiece). See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta is 7-1 against the spread (ATS) in its past eight road games. Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson has intercepted a pass in five consecutive games, the longest streak since Reggie Nelson in 2015. According to research by ESPN Stats & Information, if Jackson intercepts a pass on Sunday, he would match the longest interception streak since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, done most recently by Brian Russell in 2003. But while Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson has thrown five interceptions this season, he hasn't thrown one since Week 5. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: New England running back Damien Harris will rush for 200 yards against the NFL's 32nd-ranked rush defense. The Texans are allowing an average of 167.4 rushing yards per game, which means quarterback Cam Newton and a Patriots offense that has transformed itself into a power-running machine have a chance to feast. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: The Patriots have a 75.7 offensive efficiency over the past three weeks, fourth in the NFL during that span. It's a vast improvement from the team's 44.1 offensive efficiency in the first seven weeks (27th). Newton, who is seeking his first three-game win streak as a starting quarterback since Weeks 7-9 of 2018, has a 76.9% completion percentage over his past two games -- tops in the league over that time. What to know for fantasy: Complaining about the Patriots' backfield in fantasy needs to stop. Over the past month, Harris has accounted for 74% of New England's RB rushing yards and faces fantasy's worst run defense in terms of stopping running backs. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Houston is 2-7 ATS this season, tied with the Jets for the second-worst ATS mark in the NFL. Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Jaguars rookie quarterback Jake Luton is making his third start and facing the league's best pass rush. The Steelers lead the NFL with 36 sacks (and are tied for second with 11 interceptions), led by T.J. Watt and Bud Dupree. If the Jaguars are going to be able to stay close and potentially pull the upset, it's going to fall heavily on offensive tackles Cam Robinson and Jawaan Taylor keeping Watt and Dupree off Luton and giving him enough time to get the ball out. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: The Steelers will hold rookie running back James Robinson to 50 yards or fewer. Robinson has earned high praise from the Steelers' coaches and players leading into this matchup -- and with good reason. He's averaging 109 yards per game in the past three games, but the Steelers look to be back at nearly full strength in the run defense with the return of Tyson Alualu (knee) a week ago and Mike Hilton (shoulder) trending toward playing this week. Without the pair, the Steelers' run defense was woeful against the Cowboys and Ravens, but it'll be motivated to prove it is an elite unit when healthy. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: When the 9-0 Steelers and 1-8 Jaguars meet Sunday, it'll match the sixth-largest differential in win percentage in Week 10 or later in the Super Bowl era (excluding strike-shortened seasons). The Jaguars have allowed at least 24 points in eight consecutive games this season, their longest streak of allowing 24-plus points in franchise history. On the other side, the Steelers have scored 24-plus in all nine of their games this season, tied with the Saints for most in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Robinson has just 3 yards on seven targets over the past two weeks, after posting more than 7 yards per target earlier this season. A return to versatility is almost essential this weekend against the NFL's best defense in terms of running back fantasy points allowed. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Pittsburgh is 1-10 ATS as a double-digit road favorite under coach Mike Tomlin, with four outright losses. Read more.",48.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, who has thrown as many interceptions this season as touchdowns (12), get anything going? He will have to take care of the ball in what figures to be another bad-weather game in Cleveland. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: The Browns will score a defensive touchdown. Outside of last weekend's game against the Giants, Wentz has been very giving with the football, turning it over 16 times. Cleveland is tied for fourth with 15 takeaways and will take one to the house on Sunday. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield has zero passing touchdowns in each of his past two games. That's his longest streak without a passing TD since going three straight games without one at Texas Tech in 2013. He also has fewer than 150 passing yards in these past two games for the longest such streak of his career (NFL and college). What to know for fantasy: Both Kareem Hunt and Nick Chubb have been top-22 running backs in three of their four fully healthy games together this season for Cleveland. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: The Browns have failed to cover in each of their past four games. Read more.",35.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Washington's offense has come alive of late, surpassing 400 yards in consecutive games. It hasn't topped that total in three straight games since Weeks 15-17 of the 2015 season, but the Bengals allow 398.7 yards per game. It'll be interesting to see how well Washington runs the ball. It ranks 30th in rushing yards per game and 28th in yards per carry, but Cincinnati ranks 27th in yards allowed per game and 31st in yards allowed per carry. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow will pass for 300-plus yards. While it might not look bold on the surface, Washington enters Sunday's game with the top passing defense in the NFL. It will be a good test for Burrow, who is coming off a rough game against the Steelers in Week 10. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Washington wide receiver Terry McLaurin quietly has at least seven receptions in four consecutive games, the longest streak by a Washington player in the past 70 seasons and tied with Green Bay's Davante Adams for the longest active streak in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Washington running back J.D. McKissic is averaging 6.2 catches per game over his past six, including 16 grabs on 29 targets in the two games led primarily by QB Alex Smith. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Cincinnati is 0-17-1 outright in its past 18 road games -- but it is 11-7 ATS in those games. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will either team get enough pressure on the quarterback to disrupt the other's offense, particularly the Lions since there's some question on whom Carolina might start at quarterback? Even if Teddy Bridgewater plays, his sprained knee might limit his mobility. Neither team has been very good at producing sacks. The Panthers rank 27th in the league with 11, and the Lions are 25th with 13. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Lions running back Adrian Peterson will have 75 yards rushing and a touchdown in a vintage outing against a Carolina run defense allowing 124.5 yards per game and 4.77 yards per carry. With D'Andre Swift potentially missing this one, Peterson will get some workload help from Kerryon Johnson and Jamal Agnew out of the backfield. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Detroit wide receiver Marvin Jones has a receiving TD in three straight games, tied for the longest streak of his career (Weeks 6-8 of 2013). He is fresh off an eight-catch, 96-yard receiving day versus Washington in Week 10. What to know for fantasy: No defense is allowing more receiving yards per game to running backs than the Lions (53.7), and Panthers running back Mike Davis has hauled in 87% of his targets this season. Fun fact: There has yet to be a game this season in which multiple Davis targets hit the ground. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Carolina is 1-4 ATS at home this season. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Just how often will the Broncos turn the ball over? They have lost five fumbles and thrown a league-leading 16 interceptions. The Dolphins are tied for fourth in the league in takeaways and have confused, in particular, the young quarterbacks they've faced. Keep an eye on the Broncos' offense in the three-wide receiver set, as all 16 interceptions have come from that this season. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: The Dolphins will produce five or more sacks and multiple turnovers against the Broncos' offense. Miami's multiple defense has frustrated offenses and quarterbacks all season but has only one game with five-plus sacks (San Francisco). That changes this weekend whether it's a limited Drew Lock (who threw four interceptions last Sunday) or a backup under center, as the Dolphins' defense continues its ball-snatching ways while making it a rough day for Denver. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: Miami's Tua Tagovailoa is seeking to become the fifth AFC quarterback to win his first four career starts over the past 30 years (Drew Brees in 2002, Ben Roethlisberger in 2004, Trevor Siemian in 2016 and Patrick Mahomes in 2017-18). He also has already joined Damon Huard as the only Dolphins QBs to win their first three career starts and would be the first Dolphin to win his first four. Tagovailoa has five touchdowns and zero interceptions through three starts, joining Carson Wentz as the only rookie quarterbacks to win their first three starts and throw zero picks in the Super Bowl era (since 1966). No rookie QB has achieved that feat over his first four starts during that span. What to know for fantasy: Week 4 was the most recent time Melvin Gordon had a touch gaining more than 11 yards. That was also the the most recent time the Denver running back ranked inside the top 20 at the position for a week. The name value and recognition far outweigh what he is giving your fantasy roster. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami is 7-2 ATS this season, tied with Pittsburgh for the best ATS mark in the NFL. Read more.",41.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Jets, who are looking to 35-year-old Joe Flacco in place of an injured Sam Darnold, are 0-6 in games started by QBs other than Darnold since the start of last season (7-12 with Darnold). The Chargers, meanwhile, will be looking to avoid their first 2-8 start since 2015. Quarterback play shouldn't be a concern for them, though, as Justin Herbert has thrown multiple TDs in six consecutive games -- the longest streak by a rookie in NFL history, per Elias Sports Bureau research -- and is the only rookie in Chargers history with at least four 300-yard passing games in a season. The Jets will need to find a way to contain Herbert's big arm if they want to enter the win column this weekend. -- Shelley Smith Bold prediction: Herbert will set a career high for passing yardage, meaning he will go north of 347 on the day. The Jets' pass defense is awful, and there's a good chance it will be breaking in a new set of cornerbacks. CB1 Pierre Desir was cut this week, and CB2 Bless Austin could sit out with a neck injury. The Jets could wind up starting three rookies in the secondary. Have at it, Justin. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: All seven of the Chargers' losses this season have been one-score games. That is tied for the most in a team's first nine games in NFL history, per research by the Elias Sports Bureau (2015 Ravens, 1983 Buccaneers and 1944 Brooklyn Tigers). What to know for fantasy: Chargers tight end Hunter Henry has seen at least six targets in four of his past five games, and while the production has been spotty, don't forget that he ranks as a per-game top-10 player at the position among healthy options. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Six straight Los Angeles games have gone over the total, and the over is 6-2 in Herbert starts. Read more.",34.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Buckle up for the Colts' No. 1 defense and the Packers' No. 6 offense. Colts coach Frank Reich said Green Bay will be the toughest test of the season so far for his defense, but the Colts will also be the second top-three defense the Packers have faced this season. Tampa Bay, which is No. 3 in the NFL in total defense, held Green Bay to 201 total yards, sacked Aaron Rodgers five times, forced two turnovers and gave up only 10 points to the Packers earlier this season. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Indianapolis QB Philip Rivers will outplay Green Bay's Rodgers. Rivers was efficient against the Packers' defense last season, and the Colts' elite defense will give Rodgers fits just like the Bucs' D did in Tampa earlier this season. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: Rodgers leads the NFL with an 84.8 Total QBR this season and has three games with 300-plus passing yards and four-plus passing TDs (tied with Patrick Mahomes for the most such games). Oh, and he is 4-0 and is averaging 296.5 pass yards per game with nine passing scores in his past four games played at indoor stadiums, dating back to last season. What to know for fantasy: You might have missed Marquez Valdes-Scantling's big Week 10, but be careful. Yes, the Packers wide receiver has three games with more than 19 fantasy points this season, but he also has three games with fewer than 3.5 and is facing the seventh-best defense against fantasy WRs. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Under coach Matt LaFleur, Green Bay is 5-1 outright and ATS as a road underdog (regular season). Read more.",52.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will the Vikings manage Dalvin Cook's workload? You might expect Minnesota to lean heavy on its star running back, given it is facing a Dallas defense that is allowing the second-most rushing yards per game. But there's a caveat, and it has to do with preserving Cook for teams that will be more difficult to beat. If the Vikings have a commanding lead at any point, do we see more of backup Alexander Mattison, or perhaps more of quarterback Kirk Cousins airing it out to rookie wide receiver Justin Jefferson? After all, Minnesota is averaging 424.5 yards per game at home, while Dallas' secondary is allowing opposing QBs a 103.1 passer rating. This should be a big day for Cousins and his receivers. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott will have his first 100-yard game of the season. He was limited to 47 yards on 20 carries by Minnesota last season, and after allowing a 100-yard rusher in each of the first two games, the Vikings have not allowed more than 75 yards on the ground to a runner in the past seven contests. With the return of quaterback Andy Dalton, the Cowboys figure to have more balance on offense, which should help Elliott find some running room. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: Cousins has at least an 80.0 Total QBR in his past three games. Brett Favre (2009) is the only Vikings quarterback to produce an 80.0 Total QBR or better in four straight starts since the metric was introduced in 2006. Helping him along has been Jefferson, whose four games with 100-plus receiving yards are the most by a Vikings rookie since Hall of Famer Randy Moss in 1998. What to know for fantasy: In Dalton's lone full game this season (Week 6 against Arizona), Amari Cooper, CeeDee Lamb and Elliott all saw double-digit targets. Cooper was the fantasy producer of the trio, racking up 20.9 fantasy points on his way to a WR7 finish. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Dallas is 1-8 ATS this season, the worst cover percentage in the NFL. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Who will show up for the Raiders on defense? Las Vegas had a statement game defensively in the victory at Arrowhead Stadium last month, but 10 of the 11 players on their reserve/COVID-19 list are defensive players. Defensive end Clelin Ferrell, who tested positive, is likely out, but the rest, including safety Johnathan Abram and defensive tackles Maliek Collins and Johnathan Hankins, will be eligible to play should they test negative this week. And without a stout defense, the Raiders have no shot against the powerful Kansas City offense. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: The Raiders will have under their season average of 370 yards and get zero plays of more than 40 yards. This might not sound very bold, but consider that Las Vegas had five plays of 40-plus yards and almost 500 yards of total offense the previous time they played the Chiefs. And no matter which team wins, there will be no victory lap around the stadium afterward. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Raiders quarterback Derek Carr has a 94 QBR against the blitz this season, which ranks second behind Kansas City QB Patrick Mahomes (98). The Chiefs have blitzed on 34% of opposing QB dropbacks this season, the seventh-highest rate in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Prior to the bye, Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill had consecutive 25-plus-point games for the third time in his career. He now faces a defense that Mahomes has gashed throughout his career (26.2 fantasy points per game against the Raiders). See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Las Vegas is 5-0 ATS in its past five games against AFC West opponents. Read more.",56.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: There has been a scoring discrepancy for the Bucs in prime time versus earlier games this season. They are averaging 15.6 points for and 27 points against in prime-time games, compared to 29.6 for and 22.6 against in the earlier slates. This is their final of four prime-time games this season, and they're 1-2 in those games. To win, they'll need to shut down the run early -- a forte of theirs under defensive coordinator Todd Bowles -- to limit Rams quarterback Jared Goff's play-action opportunities and not get swept up in Los Angeles coach Sean McVay's elaborate use of motion. The Buccaneers also need to give QB Tom Brady ample time to go through his progressions and make deep throws, something he didn't have against the Saints two weeks ago. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald will record his third multisack game of the season. Sacks come in bunches, and the Rams' defensive front is on a roll, coming off a six-sack performance against Russell Wilson and the Seahawks. However, in two career games facing Brady, Donald has never taken down the three-time NFL MVP. Donald also was held without a sack against the Seahawks, so watch for the two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year to be extra motivated on Monday. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans has linked up with Brady for seven red zone TD catches this season, second among quarterback-receiver duos in the NFL (Kirk Cousins and Adam Thielen have eight). What to know for fantasy: Tampa Bay running back Ronald Jones has been a top-25 performer at the position in five of his past seven games and has a touchdown or three catches in seven straight games. See Week 11 rankings. Betting nugget: Brady is 8-1-1 ATS in his career on Monday Night Football as a favorite of seven points or fewer. Read more.",50.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Cardinals lead the NFL in accepted penalties (79), while the Patriots have the fewest in the league (36). But the Patriots are coming off a rare seven-penalty game in a loss to Houston, which could be a sign that things are headed in the wrong direction for them. How much does the penalty discrepancy show up on Sunday? -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray will make up for his injured right shoulder with his feet. He'll run for 125 yards -- a career high -- as the defense-minded Bill Belichick will be forced to pull out all the stops while trying to slow the young phenom. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: Arizona's DeAndre Hopkins leads the NFL with 912 receiving yards. He is seeking to become just the fifth Cardinals player in the Super Bowl era with at least 1,000 receiving yards through 11 team games and the first since Larry Fitzgerald did it in 2008. What to know for fantasy: Feeling lucky? Cardinals receiver Christian Kirk has as many 20-point fantasy games this season as he does games with eight or fewer fantasy points (three). See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Arizona is 5-2 against the spread (ATS) in games starting at 1 p.m. ET in the Kliff Kingsbury/Kyler Murray era. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It will be all about the Colts' defense vs. Titans running back Derrick Henry. Henry has individual bragging rights against the Colts' stingy defense because he has topped 100 yards rushing in each of the past two meetings. That's not easy to do. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Henry will rush for 125 yards against a Colts defense that is allowing only 89.2 yards on the ground per game (third in the NFL). Henry is the only back to gain 100 or more rushing yards against the Colts in the past two seasons, and he'll get his third consecutive 100-yard day this week. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: Per the Elias Sports Bureau, the Colts could become the first team to win three straight games against opponents with a .700 or better win percentage this late in the season (Week 10 or later) since the 1970 Lions. A win also would give them their best record through 11 games since starting 14-0 in 2009. What to know for fantasy: Tennessee wide receiver Corey Davis is coming off his third 100-yard performance of the season and has quietly scored at least 11.7 points in seven of eight games this season. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: When quarterback Ryan Tannehill starts regular-season games for Tennessee, overs are 17-3, including 8-2 this season. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Raiders proved once again that they can hang with the reigning Super Bowl champs in a thrilling 35-31 loss to the Chiefs on Sunday night. But it was still a loss, and now Las Vegas can't afford many more of them in a tight race for the AFC wild-card spots. The Raiders need to take advantage of a matchup against the Falcons, who have been much more competitive than their record suggests. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: The Raiders' pass rush will get to Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan for at least three sacks. Las Vegas' lack of a pass rush has been an issue (11 sacks rank 31st in the NFL), but Ryan took eight of them last week. Recent signees Vic Beasley and Takkarist McKinley -- both former Falcons -- will provide much-needed scouting reports on Atlanta. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Ryan's 82 Total QBR since Week 6 is third best in the NFL over that span. He began the season with a 61 Total QBR over the first five weeks, which ranked 21st in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Raiders tight end Darren Waller is adding upside to his stable fantasy base. Over the past two weeks, he is averaging 12.5 yards per catch, up from 7.9. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Las Vegas has covered six of its past seven road games (4-1 ATS this season). Read more.",55.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Chargers rank third in the NFL in total offense and will be the fifth team in the top five in that area to play the Bills this season. Buffalo has allowed, on average, 454 yards of offense and 31 points in its games against the other four teams, going 2-2. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert will have another huge day, passing for more than 300 yards and establishing himself as the player to beat for Offensive Rookie of the Year. He already has five days of 300-plus yards passing this season, and the Bills are allowing a middle-of-the-pack 238.7 per game. -- Shelley Smith Stat to know: The Bills enter this game coming off a bye week. They have won five straight games following a bye, tied with Titans for the longest active streak in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Week 3 was the last time Herbert failed to finish a game as a top-10 fantasy quarterback. The potential of the rookie gets the attention, but for fantasy managers, his high floor is just as appealing. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: The over is 8-2 in Buffalo games this season, tied for the highest mark in the league. Read more.",56.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will Minnesota wide receiver Adam Thielen suit up for Week 12? The Pro Bowler was moved to the reserve/COVID-19 list on Monday, though it's unclear whether he tested positive for the coronavirus or was deemed a close contact, the latter of which would increase the likelihood of him playing against Carolina. Thielen is coming off his best game of the season (8 catches, 123 yards, 2 TDs) and leads the NFL with 11 receiving touchdowns. He would be sorely missed if he's unavailable on Sunday. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Panthers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater will pass for 300 yards and two touchdowns in his return to Minnesota as a starter for the first time since he suffered a horrific left knee injury during the Vikings' 2016 training camp. Minnesota ranks 26th in the NFL in pass defense, giving up 260.7 yards per game, but has allowed no quarterback to top 300 yards in the past four games and only three all season. -- David Newton Stat to know: Vikings running back Dalvin Cook's 13 rushing touchdowns this season are tied for the most in a team's first 10 games in the past 10 seasons (Todd Gurley in 2018). The last player with 14-plus through 11 games was LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 (21). What to know for fantasy: After going over 17.5 fantasy points in four of five games to open the season, Panthers receiver Robby Anderson has been held under 15.5 in every game since. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: All five Minnesota home games have gone over the total this season. Read more.",50.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Jets will face a rookie quarterback for the second week in a row. It can't go any worse than it did last week against the Chargers' Justin Herbert, who passed for a season-high 366 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Miami's Tua Tagovailoa doesn't have as many playmakers as Herbert has at his disposal. Then again, the Jets are so young and bereft of talent that it wouldn't be a surprise if they struggle again. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: The Dolphins won't allow the Jets to score a touchdown. The Jets are averaging an NFL-low 15 points per game but have scored at least three touchdowns in each of their past two games. The Dolphins showed their defensive prowess in their first meeting in Miami, getting a shutout, and they'll duplicate it with another strong performance in a bounce-back game this Sunday. -- Cameron Wolfe Stat to know: Miami has forced a turnover in 16 straight games dating to last season, the longest active streak in the NFL. A 17th consecutive game would match the longest such streak by the Dolphins since 2000-01. What to know for fantasy: Jets receiver Breshad Perriman has turned 20 Joe Flacco targets into 50.7 fantasy points. In a small sample size, that rate (2.54) ranks in the same breath as DK Metcalf from Russell Wilson (2.41) and Davante Adams from Aaron Rodgers (2.34) this season. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami is 16-6 ATS since its Week 5 bye last season, the best mark in the league. Read more.",33.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Cincinnati is playing its first game of the season without rookie quarterback Joe Burrow, and the other options on the depth chart -- Ryan Finley and Brandon Allen, who is getting the start -- are not nearly as potent as the 2020 top overall draft pick. The Giants are looking to win their third straight game and stay in the mix to win a woeful NFC East. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: The Giants will win despite two turnovers from quarterback Daniel Jones. It doesn't matter that they are 0-5 this year when he commits two or more turnovers. This time the Giants are the better team. They will be able to overcome the miscues (coming off two clean games) for the first time this season. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: The Giants are seeking their first three-game winning streak since 2016. They are the only NFL team without a three-game winning streak in past four seasons. What to know for fantasy: Cincinnati receiver Tee Higgins led the team in targets from Finley last week after the Burrow injury, but it is Tyler Boyd who has more experience with the backup, as he saw 21 targets in three games with Finley last season. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: The Giants have covered eight straight road games, including all five under coach Joe Judge this season. Read more.",34.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Jaguars' best chance for success is to get running back James Robinson going. He is on pace to break Dominic Rhodes' record for most yards from scrimmage by an undrafted rookie and has been the Jaguars' lone bright spot on offense. If the Browns, who rank eighth in run defense, can limit Robinson, they should be able to tee off on Mike Glennon -- who gets the start at quarterback for Jacksonville this week -- even though they won't have edge rusher Myles Garrett. It could be another long day for the Jaguars' QBs. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: After failing to throw a TD pass over three games for the first time in his career, in large part due to inclement weather, Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield will bounce back with three touchdown throws in Jacksonville. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: The Jaguars are the only team in danger of being eliminated from playoff contention in Week 12 (the Jets are already eliminated), which can happen with a loss. A 10th straight loss would mark the longest losing streak within a single season in franchise history. The Browns, meanwhile, are seeking to match their best 11-game start to a season in the past 30 seasons (8-3 in 1994). What to know for fantasy: Robinson leads the league in carry share this season and is coming off his first game with both a 15-plus-yard rush and a 15-plus-yard catch. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Mayfield is 1-5 ATS in his career as a road favorite (2-4 straight up). Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Rams have lost three straight to Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers, who effectively shut down the Los Angeles offense in a 24-16 Week 6 win this season. The Rams' defense has been stout, but their offense must find a way to execute against a short-handed 49ers defense that has not only kept the pressure on quarterback Jared Goff but has also slowed the Rams' ability to run in their most recent three matchups. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald will have at least two sacks. The Niners neutralized Donald in the first matchup with a strong outside running game and quick-hitting passing game, but the Rams will be better prepared for that approach this time, and the 49ers are still working with moving parts on the interior of the offensive line. Donald hasn't had a sack in the past two games, but he'll make up for it here. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: The Rams have allowed 4.74 yards per play when sending four or fewer pass-rushers, the third-lowest average in the past 15 seasons (2008 Steelers and 2019 Patriots). Opposing quarterbacks have a 34.6 QBR when the Rams send four or fewer, lowest in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: In each of his past three games, 49ers receiver Brandon Aiyuk has produced as a top-20 fantasy receiver. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is coming off a bye, while Los Angeles is coming off a Monday night game. Since 2017, teams coming off a bye are 2-9 ATS against teams coming off a Monday game. Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: With his injury-ravaged defense, how will Broncos coach Vic Fangio keep Saints quarterback Taysom Hill in the pocket and make him at least a little uncomfortable when he is going through his progressions? Fangio has made life somewhat difficult for young quarterbacks in the first time they face his defense, and while Hill is no rookie as a player, he still has just 41 career pass attempts, with 23 of those coming last week. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Hill and running back Alvin Kamara will each throw their first career TD passes. Why not? The Saints used Kamara in some Wildcat formations last week while getting creative during QB Drew Brees' absence, and he is 1-for-1 in his career throwing the ball. Hill, meanwhile, had two rushing touchdowns but no passing TDs in his first career start at quarterback last week. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: The Saints are one of four teams with five or more games of 15-plus quarterback pressures (Buccaneers, Chiefs and Rams). They had 18 last week against the Falcons. What to know for fantasy: Kamara has only one game this season with 15-plus carries, making the first zero-catch performance of his NFL career last week with Hill under center that much more concerning in terms of sustaining fantasy excellence. Kamara was a top-10 RB in each of his first nine games this season. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Since the start of last season, New Orleans is 6-0 ATS and straight up without Brees -- Teddy Bridgewater and Hill were the fill-ins -- despite being an underdog in four of the six games. Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Chiefs' pass defense may be looking suspect in recent weeks, but the Bucs' defense just gave up a season-high 376 passing yards to the Rams, mainly due to missed tackles and coverage breakdowns. The Buccaneers are also allowing a 69.2% completion percentage against the blitz -- fourth worst in the league -- and getting picked apart in their zone coverages. It could be a long day against the defending Super Bowl champs, although Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady has shown that he can bounce back after tough losses. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes will combine with Brady for at least six touchdown passes. The two -- despite playing in some high-scoring head-to-head battles -- have never combined for more than five in a game. But the Chiefs are playing poor pass defense of late; they allowed five touchdown throws in the past two games. Mahomes has 11 TD passes in the past three games. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Mahomes has a 98 QBR when blitzed, the highest of any quarterback in a season since QBR was first tracked in 2006, and has thrown 10 touchdowns to zero interceptions when facing the blitz. He has been blitzed at the second-lowest rate in the league (20%), but Tampa Bay sends extra pass-rushers at the second-highest rate (42%) and has forced the most interceptions (seven) with its blitz. What to know for fantasy: Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill's best three performances this season have come in his past three games (85.9 fantasy points in those games). See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Brady is 10-1 ATS and 9-2 outright as a home underdog in his career. Read more.",59.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It probably doesn't matter who starts at quarterback for the Bears as long as Aaron Rodgers starts at QB for the Packers and finishes the game. Rodgers and Brett Favre have dominated the Bears. They have a combined 41-15 record against them as members of the Packers, and Rodgers comes in hot, having thrown 16 touchdowns and just two interceptions in his past five games. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: The Bears' beleaguered offense will score three touchdowns against the Packers. Trust me, forecasting even a modicum of offensive success for the Bears is the definition of a bold prediction. The Bears' offense -- ranked at or near the bottom in virtually every statistical category -- last scored three touchdowns in a game in Week 3. To say the Bears are due is an understatement. They had an extra week to prepare for the Packers, too. If the offense can't get its act together for this one, it never will. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Chicago's defense is limiting opponents to an NFL-leading third-down conversion rate of 33.3% this season, its lowest mark since 2007 (32.7%). The Packers' offense, meanwhile, ranks fourth in third-down conversion rate at 47.9%, its best mark since 2011 (48.1%). What to know for fantasy: Rodgers rattled off his fifth straight game with more than 21 fantasy points in Week 11, but he has failed to reach even 14.5 fantasy points in each of his past three meetings with the Bears. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Green Bay is 5-0 ATS after a loss under coach Matt LaFleur. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Seahawks receiver DK Metcalf erupted for seven catches, 160 yards and a touchdown in the wild-card playoff win over the Eagles in January. Philadelphia has since added cornerback Darius Slay, who will likely be assigned to Metcalf for much of Monday's game. Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz noted that Slay has had success in the past against bigger receivers but that handling Metcalf would be ""a great challenge"" for the defense. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: The Seahawks will rush for 200 yards. They rediscovered their running game last week against Arizona, with Carlos Hyde returning from his three-game absence, and they expect to have starter Chris Carson back against Philadelphia after he missed four games. Coach Pete Carroll talked after their win over the Cardinals about how the Seahawks need to run the ball more than they did earlier in the season, when they were leaning on Russell Wilson and the passing game to carry their offense. Jumping out to an early lead will make that a viable game plan on Monday night. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz leads the league in both interceptions (14) and fumbles (10). Only five players have finished the season as league leader in both categories since the 1970 merger (Blake Bortles in 2015, Jon Kitna in 2007, Daunte Culpepper in 2002, Dave Krieg in 1995 and Joe Ferguson in 1977). What to know for fantasy: The Seahawks are allowing 24.2% more WR fantasy points per game than any other defense this season and could prove to be an elixir for a receiver like Travis Fulgham, who has nearly as many targets over the past two weeks (12) as he does yards (16). See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Wentz is 3-7 ATS as a starter this season, tied with Deshaun Watson for the worst ATS record this season among quarterbacks with 10-plus starts. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Ravens were able to run all over Pittsburgh earlier this month, but Mark Ingram and J.K. Dobbins are both going to miss the rematch, as they are both on the reserve/COVID-19 list. And the Steelers' pressure and ability to make Robert Griffin -- who will start in place of Lamar Jackson (also on the list) -- uncomfortable are very effective. Look for them to dial it up. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger will throw four touchdown passes. Since 2013, he is 4-1 against the Ravens at Heinz Field, throwing 13 touchdowns and three interceptions (104.0 passer rating). And in Baltimore's four losses this season, the defense has given up 10 touchdown passes and recorded one interception. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: The Steelers are the 14th team since the 16-game schedule was introduced (1978) to start with a 10-0 record, and only one of those teams finished with fewer than 13 wins (the 2015 Patriots went 12-4). Pittsburgh can clinch a playoff spot in Week 12 with a victory and losses by the Raiders and Dolphins on Sunday. It would match the earliest clinching since the playoffs expanded to 12 teams in 1990 (now 14 teams), but only one of the six teams that clinched a postseason spot in Week 12 has gone on to win the Super Bowl (Washington in 1991). What to know for fantasy: Baltimore wide receiver Marquise Brown has seen his fantasy point total decline in each of his past five games. See Week 12 rankings. Betting nugget: Pittsburgh is 8-2 ATS this season, the best mark in the NFL. Read more.",59.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Hidden in the camouflage of the Broncos playing last Sunday against the Saints with no quarterbacks available for the game was the fact Denver used a variety of coverage looks and pressures to limit Saints quarterback Taysom Hill to 78 yards passing and sack him three times. If the Falcons can keep the Saints in third-and-long, or even third-and-midrange, they could put it in Hill's hands and try some of the same things. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Hill will throw the first two touchdown passes of his career, and wide receiver Michael Thomas will catch his first two of this season. Both of them are long overdue, and the breakthrough will come at Atlanta, even though the Falcons' defense has shown great improvement lately and just decimated the Raiders last weekend. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan has six games this season with a Total QBR of at least 80, the third most in the NFL. And he needs just three passing touchdowns for his 12th consecutive season with at least 20, which would tie for the fourth-longest streak in NFL history. What to know for fantasy: Saints running back Alvin Kamara's worst two career games against the Falcons on a per-touch basis have come in his past two meetings with the division rivals. The 0.81 points per touch he averaged in Week 11 was the 11th-worst game of his professional career. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: New Orleans has covered four straight games, including in Week 11 against Atlanta. Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: This game is a matchup of the league's top two rushing attacks. If it is close into the fourth quarter, it will come down to which team is able to wear the other down. With both defenses committing to stopping the run, don't be surprised if there is an explosive play off of play-action, too. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Running backs Derrick Henry (Titans), Nick Chubb (Browns) and Kareem Hunt (Browns) will combine to score six touchdowns and rush for more than 400 yards. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: Henry and Chubb rank 1-2, respectively, in the NFL in rushing yards per game and 100-yard rushing games since the start of last season. The Browns rank No. 1 in the NFL in rushing percentage at 50%, while the Titans are third at 47%. What to know for fantasy: Since 2018, Henry is averaging 37.1% more fantasy points per game over the Titans' final seven games than their first nine of the season. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: When quarterback Ryan Tannehill starts regular-season games for Tennessee, overs are 18-3, including 9-1 in the Titans' past 10 games. Read more.",65.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can Colts wide receiver T.Y. Hilton continue to torch the Texans? In 16 career games against Houston, Hilton has 85 catches for 1,537 yards and 10 touchdowns, by far the most against an AFC South team. And despite a slow start, Hilton is coming off his best outing of the season and has a history of big games at NRG Stadium. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: Houston do-everything defensive lineman J.J. Watt will have his second multisack game of the season. Yes, Colts quarterback Philip Rivers has been sacked only 10 times this season, but there's a chance starting left tackle Anthony Castonzo will miss the game with a knee injury. It's hard enough to stop Watt with a starting tackle. It's really difficult to contain him with a backup. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: The Texans are averaging 83.9 rushing yards per game this season, 31st in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: For the season, Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson averages 58.1% more fantasy points per throw to Will Fuller than to all other Texans players. On Monday, Fuller was suspended for six games. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Houston is 1-5 against the spread (ATS) against teams with winning records this season, and 3-2 ATS against all others. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: With 82 receiving yards against Jacksonville, Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson would become just the fifth rookie to reach 1,000 receiving yards in the first 12 games of his career during the Super Bowl era. Jefferson leads all rookies with 918 receiving yards and ranks second in receptions (52) and touchdown catches (six). -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph will have two touchdown catches. The Jaguars, Jets and Chargers have all given up a league-high nine TD catches to tight ends. Rudolph has just one this season and is coming off season highs in catches (seven) and yards (68) against Carolina. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: The Jaguars have allowed 24-plus points in 10 straight games this season, their longest streak of allowing 24 points in franchise history. The Vikings have scored 24-plus points in eight of their 11 games this season, but they are just 4-4 in those games. What to know for fantasy: Jefferson has surpassed 17.5 fantasy points in back-to-back-to-back games (26 last weekend against the Panthers). See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: All six Minnesota home games have gone over the total this season. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Dolphins cornerback Xavien Howard leads the NFL with seven interceptions, all over the past nine games. The NFL's best ball hawk might get a chance to add to his pick total this weekend while facing Brandon Allen, the injury replacement for Joe Burrow at quarterback who committed two turnovers vs. the Giants last weekend. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: The Bengals will have fewer than 250 yards of total offense. Between a strong pass defense and a Bengals team that is without its starting quarterback (Burrow) and starting running back (Joe Mixon), gaining yards will be a difficult task. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: The Dolphins average 0.06 expected points added per play with quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick on field this season, and minus-0.08 with Tua Tagovailoa. That is equivalent to the difference between the 18th- and 31st-ranked offenses. What to know for fantasy: Miami wide receiver DeVante Parker racked up 14 targets and 119 yards in Fitzpatrick's return to the starting lineup. In Tagovailoa's four starts, Parker averaged 6.3 targets and 39.8 yards per game. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami has covered in six of its past seven games, and Miami is 17-6 ATS since its Week 5 bye last season, the best mark in the league. Read more.",37.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky's time in Chicago is nearing an end, but he does usually light up the hapless Lions. In six career appearances versus Detroit, Trubisky has passed for 1,601 yards, 14 touchdowns and four interceptions (106.0 quarterback rating), including four consecutive games with at least three touchdowns and a passer rating over 100.0. Trubisky threw for three fourth-quarter scores to lead Chicago to that improbable comeback victory at Ford Field in Week 1. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Darrell Bevell will win his debut as the interim Detroit Lions coach as the team gets a bump from a new, changed voice. In that victory, Matthew Stafford will look like the quarterback he was in 2019, throwing for more than 300 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the team's most complete offensive showing of the season. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: The Lions are one of four teams this season without a win in a divisional game (Chargers, Jets and Bengals). In fact, they have lost nine straight divisional games, currently tied for the longest active such losing streak in the NFL (Chargers). What to know for fantasy: Desperate for a fantasy QB? The Bears have won each of the past four meetings with the Lions, and Trubisky has thrown three touchdown passes in each one of those games (26.0 fantasy points per game in those matchups). See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Detroit is 1-11 outright and 3-9 ATS in its past 12 division games. Read more.",50.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Raiders have dropped two straight, jeopardizing their playoff chances, but they now face the ideal opponent. The Jets are everybody's favorite get-well matchup. They have faced five teams that entered the game on losing streaks, ranging from two to four games, and the Jets lost them all. So, yes, the Raiders might be reeling after last weekend's ugly defeat to the Falcons, but have no fear ... the Jets are here to make it all better. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: Ageless Jets running back Frank Gore will rush for 100 yards for the first time since September 2019. He is coming off a season-best 74 yards in a loss to the Dolphins, and the Raiders' run defense -- ranked 13th in the NFL in allowing an average of 113.4 yards on the ground -- has been more than suspect. Gore turning back the clock and keeping the Las Vegas offense off the field will keep things interesting in the Meadowlands ... for a while. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Jets quarterback Sam Darnold has no passing TDs in each of his past four starts, the longest active streak in the NFL. A fifth consecutive game without a touchdown pass would tie the longest such streak by a Jets QB in the past 40 seasons (Geno Smith was the most recent to do so, in 2013). What to know for fantasy: Gore's carry count increased for a third straight game, and he has multiple receptions in all three of those games. This weekend, he gets the fourth-worst defense in terms of defending fantasy running backs this season. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: The over is 8-3 in Las Vegas games this season, the second-highest over percentage in the NFL this season. Read more.",50.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It'll be known early in the game just how much Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray's right shoulder has improved. If he starts running early, then it's better. If he doesn't, then it's still an issue. Coach Kliff Kingsbury won't run Murray on designed calls if there's a chance of him getting hit and hurt more. But whether Murray runs will have a distinct impact and could be the difference between Arizona winning -- or losing for the fourth time in five games. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Rookie Rams running back Cam Akers will tally his first 100-rushing-yard game. The Rams have not been able to get their running game going since Week 10, but against a Cardinals defense that is allowing an average of 123 yards per game, watch for coach Sean McVay to commit to it. Akers is coming off a nine-carry, 84-yard performance in Week 12. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: The Cardinals lead NFL in yards per rush (5.0), rank fourth in rushing yards per game (155.9) and sit at second in run block win rate (73%). But the Rams have allowed the fourth-fewest rushing yards per game (93.5) this season. What to know for fantasy: Cause for concern? The Rams have been the best defense against fantasy receivers this season, and three of DeAndre Hopkins' four worst games this season have come since Arizona's Week 8 bye. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Arizona is 12-6-1 ATS as an underdog under Kingsbury. And it's 5-3 ATS as a home underdog under Kingsbury, with all five covers also going over the total. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Keep an eye on Seattle wide receiver DK Metcalf versus New York cornerback James Bradberry. The NFL's leading WR has been getting lots of attention from opposing defenses' top corners this season, with mostly good results. Metcalf set a career high with 177 yards on Monday night while doing most of his damage against Darius Slay. He figures to see plenty of Bradberry on Sunday. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Seahawks wide receiver Tyler Lockett will have double-digit receptions. The Giants' defensive weaknesses include their CB2 and slot cornerback. That sets up perfectly for Lockett, who is 10th in the NFL with 33 catches out of the slot for 352 yards. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson ranks fifth in QBR (78.1) versus zone coverage this season with nine touchdowns, which trails only Patrick Mahomes' 11. The Giants utilize zone coverage on 66.1% of opponent dropbacks, the second-highest rate this season (Panthers at 69.7%). What to know for fantasy: Giants running back Wayne Gallman has rushed for a touchdown in five consecutive games, but more important for the sustainability of his status as a top-20 fantasy running back, he matched a season high with five targets in Week 12. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: The Giants have covered in eight of their past nine road games. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: From the Aaron Rodgers never forgets file: The Eagles beat the Packers in Week 4 of last season when they picked off Rodgers at the goal line with 20 seconds left to seal the game. Since then, the Packers quarterback has thrown 53 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 23 regular-season games. He needs three touchdown passes to reach 400 for his career. Drew Brees currently owns the record for fastest to 400 touchdown passes (205 games); Rodgers has played in 192. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Packers running back Aaron Jones will find the end zone twice. He hasn't had a multiple-touchdown game since Week 2 against the Lions, but with the Eagles focused on Rodgers and defensive tackle Fletcher Cox dealing with a neck injury, Jones will lead the scoring charge for the Packers. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz has an off-target rate of 23.3% this season, which ranks last in the NFL. The Eagles quarterback was ranked 11th out of 32 QBs in the category last season at 16.6%. What to know for fantasy: Jones hasn't been the fantasy superstar we had hoped for over the past two months, but he did average 5.3 yards per carry against a tough Bears defense last weekend and has hauled in 15 of 17 targets over his past four games. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Philadelphia is 1-4 ATS on the road this season. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can Justin Herbert outduel Cam Newton? He has six 300-yard passing games, tied for most by a rookie in NFL history (Andrew Luck in 2012). And with four more passing touchdowns, he'd tie Baker Mayfield for the rookie record of 27. -- Shelley Smith Bold prediction: After the Patriots' Gunner Olszewski saw a punt-return TD nullified by a penalty last weekend, he will take one to the house against a Chargers special-teams unit that has had its struggles in 2020. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: Newton has four passing touchdowns and nine interceptions this season. That 0.44 TD-INT rate is the second worst by a quarterback with 250 pass attempts in a season in the past decade out of 344 qualifying QB seasons (Jimmy Clausen was at 0.33 in 2010). What to know for fantasy: Over the past four weeks, Chargers tight end Hunter Henry ranks top-five at the position in targets, catches and fantasy points. Over that stretch, his 1.3 end-zone targets per game ranks seventh in the league across all positions. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: The Chargers have failed to cover in five consecutive games. Read more.",48.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Broncos generate enough offense to keep up with the Chiefs? The Chiefs have outscored the Broncos 96-25 in the past three games between the two teams, with the margins being 24, 20 and 27 points. So Denver has to figure out a way to move the ball and score some points. The Chiefs haven't been playing well of late on defense, but the prospect still seems dim for the Broncos. Even discounting last weekend's QB-less disaster against the Saints, they're averaging fewer than 21 points per game. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Broncos quarterback Drew Lock, a native of Lee's Summit, Missouri, will throw his first career touchdown pass against the team he watched growing up. In two career starts against the Chiefs, he has twice had at least 40 pass attempts, and none has gone for a TD. Lock needs some of his best work in this one, given he's taking some heat for missing last weekend's game after failing to abide by COVID-19 protocols and is still in a season-long audition for the future. Oh, and the Chiefs are going for their 11th win in a row in this long rivalry. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has won seven consecutive prime-time games, and his 36 passing touchdowns in his 14 career prime-time starts is already the most by a player through his first 15 prime-time starts in the Super Bowl era. What to know for fantasy: Don't sleep on Denver receiver KJ Hamler. He saw 26 targets in the three games prior to the Week 12 mess, and nearly 72% of yards gained in the NFL this season when playing from behind have been gained through the air. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: This is the second straight game that Denver is a double-digit underdog. It hasn't been a double-digit underdog twice in the same season since 1975. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Coming off an ugly win against the Ravens, the Steelers are working on a short week and facing a Washington team that had extra time to get ready for the NFL's lone undefeated team. The Steelers will likely still be without running back James Conner and center Maurkice Pouncey (reserve/COVID-19 list), meaning they'll be short-handed against a sneaky good defensive team that has proved to be solid against the pass and the run. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: The Steelers' offense has not been about hitting downfield passes this season; its receivers average an NFL-low 10.23 yards per catch. But Pittsburgh will have one 50-plus-yard touchdown on Monday against a defense that has allowed an NFL-worst six catches of 50-plus yards. -- John Keim Stat to know: Washington quarterback Alex Smith is averaging 4.91 air yards per pass attempt, the shortest among 33 qualified passers. It is the lowest mark by any passer with at least 150 attempts in a season since it was first tracked in 2006. But 58.2% of Washington's receiving yards have come after the catch, the highest rate in the NFL this season, and Terry McLaurin leads all wide receivers with 445 yards after the catch. What to know for fantasy: Washington running back Antonio Gibson set or matched season highs in rushing attempts (20), catches (five) and targets (seven) during the Thanksgiving win over the Cowboys. But it is worth noting that Gibson is averaging 27.7 fantasy points per game against the Cowboys this season and 14 against the rest of the NFL. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: The Steelers are 8-3 ATS, tied with the Dolphins for best ATS record in the league. Read more.",36.0,LOW
" What to watch for: This has been another wild week in the most unusual of seasons for the 49ers, who are coming off an emotional victory against the Rams and now must regroup while relocating to Arizona for at least the next three weeks. Bills quarterback Josh Allen's mobility presents a big challenge for San Francisco's defense, but it's also fair to wonder if the late-season move to the desert and its fallout will have an adverse effect on the Niners in a game they've got to have to stay in the NFC playoff race. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: As Buffalo plays its second of at least three games without wideout John Brown, Gabriel Davis will register the first 100-yard game of his career, finishing as the Bills' leading receiver for the second straight game. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: Niners wide receiver Deebo Samuel's 1,293 career yards from scrimmage is the sixth most through two seasons by a 49ers WR, trailing Jerry Rice (2,595), Dave Parks (2,047), Gene Washington (1,807), Terrell Owens (1,456) and Michael Crabtree (1,366). And Samuel has missed time with an injury and still has five games to play this season. What to know for fantasy: Bills wideout Stefon Diggs ranks third in the league in both catches and targets per game. That's an elite résumé, and the elite receivers who have faced the 49ers this season have lit them up. Davante Adams, DK Metcalf and DeAndre Hopkins all surpassed 29 fantasy points in this spot, averaging 34.2 in the process. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: The over is 8-3 in Buffalo games this season, tied for the second-highest mark in the league. Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: On Saturday, Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson will complete his 10-day quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19, but it's unknown how effective the reigning NFL MVP will be with one expected practice. Jackson gets a favorable matchup with the Cowboys, the only team in the NFL that is allowing more than 30 points per game. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Ravens wide receiver Dez Bryant will catch a touchdown pass against his former team. He set the Cowboys' franchise record with 73 touchdown receptions from 2010 through 2017, but his most recent touchdown came on Dec. 10, 2017. There will be nothing better for Bryant than to ""throw up the X"" against the Cowboys. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: The Cowboys are scoring on just 50% (17 of 34) of their drives that reach the red zone, the fourth-worst mark in the league this season. And they have scored just three touchdowns on 12 red zone drives since Week 7 (that 25% mark is the worst over that span), with all three coming in the victory over the Vikings. What to know for fantasy: Earlier this season with Dak Prescott at QB, Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott caught at least six passes in three straight games. Elliott had six catches in all of November. See Week 13 rankings. Betting nugget: Dallas is 2-9 ATS this season, the worst cover percentage in the NFL. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Miami's Xavien Howard is playing like the NFL's best cornerback with a league-best eight interceptions. But Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill has been one of the NFL's most explosive players, ranking third in receiving yards and sitting tied for first in touchdowns. Since Week 5, the Chiefs have had the NFL's top scoring offense, while the Dolphins have the top scoring defense. It's a classic battle of great versus great. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: The Chiefs will intercept Tua Tagovailoa twice on Sunday. The Dolphins' quarterback has yet to throw an interception this season, but the Chiefs are tied for second in the league in interceptions with 14 and had their way with another young QB, Denver's Drew Lock, this season. They intercepted Lock four times in two games. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has thrown for 31 touchdowns with two interceptions this season. The fewest interceptions in a season with at least 30 passing TDs is four, done by Tom Brady in 2010 (36 TDs). Both of Mahomes' picks this season have come against the Raiders. What to know for fantasy: Due for a spike in production? Based on the location of carries, Dolphins running back Myles Gaskin's production as a rusher is 26.6% below expectations, the second-worst rate of all qualifiers. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami has covered in seven of its past eight games. It is 18-6 against the spread (ATS) since its Week 5 bye last season, the best mark in the league over that time. Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bucs' top-ranked rushing defense is giving up just 74 rushing yards per game and has yet to allow a 100-yard rusher this season, while Minnesota running back Dalvin Cook boasts the league's second-most rushing yards with 1,250. The Bucs made the Chiefs and Rams one-dimensional, and Patrick Mahomes and Jared Goff still thrived, but this will be a big test for Vikings QB Kirk Cousins. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady will throw for 350 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. The Bucs' bye week will prove to be just what the offense needed to get back on track, and as a bonus, Brady's deep passing attack will look rejuvenated. Against a young Vikings secondary, Brady will avoid his first regular-season three-game losing streak since 2002. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Minnesota wide receiver Justin Jefferson has 1,039 receiving yards this season, putting him on pace for 1,385. That would be second most all time by a rookie behind Bill Groman's 1,473 in 1960. What to know for fantasy: That's not one, not two, but three straight games with more than 21 fantasy points for Cousins. It should be noted, however, that all three of those games came at home. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Brady is 46-19 ATS in his career after a loss, including 4-0 ATS with Tampa Bay. Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Giants have rushed for at least 132 yards in six of their past seven games. This week, they get to face the league's 22nd-ranked rushing attack. How running back Wayne Gallman & Co. do against Arizona's defense will go a long way in determining the final outcome of this contest. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins will have 125 yards and a touchdown, but it won't be enough because the Cardinals will be playing from behind for most of the game. Hopkins hasn't had 100 yards receiving since Week 10, so he's due for a big game. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: The Giants had 15 turnovers and 10 takeaways in their first eight games. Over their past four, they have committed only two turnovers and secured 10 takeaways. What to know for fantasy: Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray's worst three games this season have come in succession, and yet his 308 fantasy points still rank second across all positions. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: The Giants are 8-2 ATS as an underdog this season with seven straight covers. Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The buildup in Chicago is all about Houston's Deshaun Watson, one of two franchise quarterbacks the Bears bypassed in favor of Mitchell Trubisky in the 2017 NFL draft. The game itself is almost inconsequential. Bears fans will hang on every Watson throw, the way they did when Patrick Mahomes visited Soldier Field last year. Mahomes embarrassed the Bears. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Watson will throw for three touchdowns and set his single-season career high (27). That would also be the second most in a single season in Texans history. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: The Bears are 30th in offensive efficiency and yards per game, but the Texans rank 30th in defensive efficiency and opponent yards per game. What to know for fantasy: On a per-game basis, Bears running back David Montgomery is RB7 since the Tarik Cohen injury. He faces the second-most friendly defense to opposing running backs this weekend. See Week 14 rankings.

" What to watch for: Can the Panthers keep quarterback Teddy Bridgewater clean against a defense tied for eighth in the NFL in sacks with 32? Bridgewater might be without several of his top weapons, with running back Christian McCaffrey in doubt with a quad injury and wide receivers DJ Moore and Curtis Samuel on the NFL's reserve/COVID-19 list. He might need more time than normal to give more inexperienced players a chance to create separation. But when Bridgewater is kept clean, the Panthers are usually competitive. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Broncos quarterback Drew Lock will have his first interception-free day since Week 2 (when he threw just four passes before exiting with a shoulder injury). Lock has struggled in the turnover department since he returned in Week 5 from that injury and has tossed 13 interceptions in his seven starts since then. But he says he has gotten the message, and the Panthers defense has intercepted just five passes this season. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Lock ranks in the bottom four among all 32 qualified quarterbacks in Total QBR (29th), completion percentage (32nd) and TD-to-interception ratio (30th). What to know for fantasy: Will McCaffrey be back this week? The consensus first overall pick in fantasy drafts has appeared in three games this season, the last of which was Week 9. And yet, in Weeks 1-9, he ranked as RB26 with 90.4 fantasy points. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Carolina is 0-4 ATS in both its past four games as a favorite and its past four as a home favorite. Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Dalvin Cook ran for 120 yards against the Jaguars last week but needed 32 carries to do it. That's just 3.8 yards per carry. But Tennessee tailback Derrick Henry is a different style of runner and has absolutely feasted on the Jaguars in the past two late-season matchups: 397 yards, six TDs and 11.0 yards per carry. The Jaguars have spent all week working on tackling and trying to defend against Henry's vicious stiff-arm. Henry might get his yards but, like Cook, is going to have to work for them. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: Titans receivers A.J. Brown and Corey Davis will each have 100-yard receiving games, and quarterback Ryan Tannehill will pass for over 300 yards, as the Titans' offense has a field day against the Jaguars. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: Jaguars running back James Robinson needs only 42 rushing yards to become the fourth undrafted rookie with 1,000 in the common draft era (1967). And he has seven games with 100 scrimmage yards, tied with Clark Gaines ( in 1976) for most by an undrafted rookie. What to know for fantasy: Robinson is having a great season, but his ceiling is capped. Among qualifiers, only Frank Gore has fewer expected fantasy points per carry based on the location of rushes. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: When Tannehill starts regular-season games for Tennessee, overs are 18-3-1, including 9-2-1 this year. Read more.",58.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Cowboys quarterback Andy Dalton is making his return to Cincinnati, where he was a starter for the first nine years of his career. The loser of this game will strengthen its position for the No. 3 pick in the 2021 draft, and the Bengals have dropped four straight games, struggling to score since QB Joe Burrow suffered a season-ending knee injury. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: The Cowboys will not have a turnover against the Bengals. While that might not seem bold for most teams, it is for the Cowboys. They have had at least one giveaway in all but two games this season. Dalton has at least one pick in each of his five starts as the quarterback, but he will not have one in his return to Cincinnati. Only four teams have fewer takeaways than the Bengals' 12, including the Cowboys. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: Dallas has allowed 167.8 rushing yards per game this season, on pace to be the second-worst mark in a season in Cowboys history (186.8 in 1960). In more recent history, it's also the worst mark by any NFL team since the 2010 Bills (169.6). What to know for fantasy: Bengals receiver Tee Higgins has at least five targets in 11 straight games and at least five catches in six of his past seven. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Dallas is 2-9 ATS this season, the worst cover percentage in the NFL. Read more.",36.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Raiders will be trying to get their running game going against the No. 7-ranked rush defense in the NFL. In Weeks 8-10, Las Vegas averaged 190.7 yards per game on the ground. The past three weeks, it's only 67.0 per game. If the Colts make the Raiders a one-dimensional passing team, they can make QB Derek Carr uncomfortable in the pocket. So keep an eye on Las Vegas' right tackle spot, where Trent Brown just might appear in only his third game this season. ""He's the best in the world at what he does,"" Carr said of Brown. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: The Colts will sack Carr at least three times. Carr has been sacked five times over the past two games by Atlanta and the Jets, teams who both are in the bottom half of the NFL in sacks. The Colts, meanwhile, could be the healthiest they've been in several weeks on defense, if linebacker Bobby Okereke and safety Khari Willis return from their injuries. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: Raiders tight end Darren Waller is second among all tight ends in receptions (77) and receiving yards (742). He's coming off a game with 13 receptions for 200 yards and a pair of scores. But the Colts have allowed the fewest yards per attempt (5.0) and fewest TDs (one, tied with the Patriots) to tight ends this season. What to know for fantasy: Indianapolis receiver T.Y. Hilton has more fantasy points over his past two games (43.1) than he had over his previous six. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: The Colts are 7-2 ATS in their past nine games as a favorite. Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: As if Jamal Adams facing the team that dealt him to Seattle this summer after a messy divorce isn't enough of a storyline on its own, the All-Pro safety can make NFL history. His team-high 7.5 sacks are a half-sack shy of Adrian Wilson's NFL record for most in a season by a defensive back since those became an official statistic in 1982. With as much as the Seahawks blitz Adams and as motivated as he figures to be against the Jets, there's a good chance he gets the record on Sunday. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf will have a career receiving day, meaning more than 177 yards. The Jets have a new defensive coordinator, as Frank Bush replaces the fired Gregg Williams on an interim basis, but they have the same old defense. And the Jets simply don't have any cornerbacks who can match up physically with Metcalf. This could be a historic day. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: A team 0-12 or worse has beaten a team with a winning record one time in the Super Bowl era. In 2011, the 0-13 Colts defeated the 7-6 Titans. What to know for fantasy: Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson averaged 21.2 points per game through nine weeks, but he has failed to even reach that number in each of his past four games. Over that stretch, he has 14.9 fantasy points per game. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Seattle is the seventh team since 2010 to be a double-digit favorite immediately after losing outright as a double-digit favorite. Each of the previous six covered. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The 49ers are coming off a disappointing loss, and their slim playoff hopes are on the line, while Washington enters off a big win and is chasing the NFC East crown. Much like the Niners, Washington has invested serious resources in its defensive front and is starting to reap the benefits, as it ranks fifth in the league in pass rush win rate (an ESPN metric powered by NFL Next Gen Stats). San Francisco, meanwhile, is 20th in pass block win rate and has struggled consistently from center to right tackle. How well the Niners hold up against Washington's rapidly evolving front four will go a long way in determining a winner here. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: Washington receiver Terry McLaurin will become the sixth opposing receiver to surpass 100 yards against the 49ers this season (three have topped 150) and will also score once. He was held to 14 yards by Pittsburgh, in part because the Steelers focused hard on him. But against the 49ers, McLaurin will be a bigger part of the attack. San Francisco ranks 17th in catches allowed by receivers and 28th in touchdowns. -- John Keim Stat to know: Washington quarterback Alex Smith is averaging a league-low 5.16 air yards per attempt, the lowest mark by any qualified passer since ESPN began tracking it in 2006. What to know for fantasy: On a per-game basis, 49ers receiver Brandon Aiyuk is WR3 since Week 8, trailing only Tyreek Hill and Davante Adams. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is 1-5 ATS and outright at home this season. Read more.",42.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Lions were invigorated by the change in coach from Matt Patricia to Darrell Bevell last week. This week? That can only carry a team so far, and Green Bay is one of the NFL's best teams. The Lions' poor defense is still their poor defense, and the roster still has big-time holes in it. Those holes could show up in a big way on Sunday. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: The Packers will set not one but two milestones. First, wide receiver Davante Adams will catch a touchdown in his eighth straight game to break Don Hutson's nearly 80-year-old team record. Second, quarterback Aaron Rodgers will throw four touchdown passes to get to 40 on the season for the third time in his career, which would be the most in NFL history. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: On play-action, Rodgers has an NFL-high 18 passing touchdowns with zero interceptions this season. That's the most in a season since it was first tracked in 2006. His 74% completion percentage on play-action passes is also No. 1 in the NFL, while his 96.8 passing yards per game on those plays ranks second. What to know for fantasy: Rodgers is averaging 0.66 fantasy points per pass attempt, his most since 2011. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Green Bay is 5-1 ATS against teams with losing records this season. Read more.",56.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts' first career start comes against the No. 1 defense in the NFL. The Saints are allowing 289 yards per game (first), 20.1 points per game (fourth) and have racked up 36 sacks (tied for third). Veteran safety Malcolm Jenkins made the move from Philly to New Orleans in the offseason and knows the Eagles' offense extremely well, which could further complicate things for the rookie QB. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: Saints running backs Alvin Kamara and Latavius Murray will each gain more than 100 yards from scrimmage. We saw the Saints lean heavily on their backfield two weeks ago at Denver, where the Broncos were without a starting QB. I expect a similar conservative game plan outdoors at Philly in Hurts' starting debut, especially since the Saints are so good at running the ball. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Hurts will be the 11th different starting quarterback in the NFC East this season, the second most by a division since the 2002 realignment (AFC North in 2015 with 12). It'll be the first time since 2004 all four teams of the NFC East used multiple starting QBs. What to know for fantasy: Over the past four weeks, there have been 66 instances in which a running back scored at least 14 fantasy points in a game, and Eagles running back Miles Sanders has not accounted for any of those instances. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Since the start of the 2018 season, New Orleans is 17-5 ATS on the road. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert will have to figure out how to bounce back from a blowout by New England against a suspect Atlanta defense. He has 23 passing touchdowns, four shy of matching Baker Mayfield's rookie record of 27 set in 2018, but this will be a big test in how he responds to adversity. -- Shelley Smith Bold prediction: The Chargers will be held without a touchdown for a second straight game. They'll be more productive on offense than they were in last week's debacle but still won't find the end zone against the Falcons, who are improved defensively under interim coach Raheem Morris. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Falcons receivers Calvin Ridley and Julio Jones are two of just seven players averaging 15-plus yards per reception with 50 catches on the year. What to know for fantasy: Chargers running back Austin Ekeler has 25 targets in his two games since returning to action (17 targets this season prior). See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Los Angeles is coming off a 45-0 loss. Since 2015, teams coming off a 40-point loss are 0-6-1 ATS in their next game. Read more.",41.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Over the past four weeks, the Bills own the second-best passing offense in the NFL in terms of yards per game. But the Steelers have allowed the third-fewest passing yards per game in that span. Considering Buffalo's struggles to run the ball effectively this season, it's critical that the Bills either figure out a way to solve Pittsburgh's pass defense or get their run game going. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: James Washington will lead Pittsburgh receivers in targets. The Steelers had a whopping seven drops in the loss to Washington, and coach Mike Tomlin said afterward that receivers who can't catch the ball will be replaced by those who can. Though explosive, Diontae Johnson has struggled the most with drops, recording three last week, and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has openly campaigned to get Washington on the field more often. Washington is known for making combat catches and explosive plays, two things that will be needed against a tough Bills team. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: The Bills' offense leads the league in both third- (49.3%) and fourth-down conversion rate (83.3%) this season. And that third-down rate is the highest by any team since the 2011 Saints (56.7%). What to know for fantasy: Yes, Johnson may lead the league in drops this season, but the consistent work has him as WR4 in total points over the past month. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Pittsburgh is 8-4 ATS this season, the second-best mark in the NFL. Read more.",46.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Two of this game's biggest stars -- Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson and Browns defensive end Myles Garrett -- continue to work their way back after testing positive for the coronavirus. Both players, who performed well in their returns this past week, will be instrumental as Baltimore and Cleveland make their playoff pushes. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: The Ravens will be held to a season low in points. Jackson and the Baltimore offense is coming off a game in which they scored 34 points and ran for 294 yards. But that came against a struggling Cowboys defense, whereas the Browns have held teams to 18.8 points at home this season, the fourth fewest in the NFL. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: The Browns have a minus-15 point differential this season, the worst by any team with at least nine wins through 12 games in NFL history, via Elias Sports Bureau data. What to know for fantasy: Jackson was QB6 in Week 13, matching his best finish since opening the season with a QB4 performance in Week 1. See Week 14 rankings. Betting nugget: Cleveland is 0-4 ATS against AFC North opponents this season. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: After losing five cornerbacks -- four to injuries and A.J. Bouye to a suspension -- in the past three weeks, Denver has just three available on the roster, and one of them (Nate Hairston) was signed off the Ravens' practice squad just a week ago. The Bills have the No. 3 passing offense in the league, and quarterback Josh Allen has six 300-yard games this season and two 400-yard games. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Buffalo wide receiver Stefon Diggs will go wild on Saturday. With the Broncos' struggles at cornerback, that might not be too bold of a prediction, but this might be: He will set a new career high and eclipse the 201 receiving yards he needs to become the Bills' single-season receiving leader. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: Allen has an 89.2 Total QBR when facing a blitz (five or more pass-rushers) this season. That's sixth best in the NFL, and way up from his 54.2 QBR against blitzes in his first two seasons. What to know for fantasy: Allen is averaging 11.6% more fantasy points per game on the road than at home this season. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Buffalo has covered in each of its past five games. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Watch the sideline when the Packers score a touchdown or get a long field goal, and you'll see a component of why coach Matt LaFleur has been so successful: He's right there celebrating with the players. Watch when something goes wrong, and he's right there to question why. LaFleur has found a balance, leading to a 23-6 record since taking over in 2019. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, if the Packers win Saturday, he would be just the sixth head coach to win at least 24 of his first 30 games, joining George Seifert (27), Guy Chamberlin (26), Paul Brown (25), George Halas (24) and Steve Mariucci (24). -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Panthers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater will throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns. Perhaps even more bold, he will lead his first comeback win of the season on the last possession after going 0-7 in those scenarios thus far. It'll come down to a deep pass to wide receiver DJ Moore to set up a Joey Slye game-winning field goal. -- David Newton Stat to know: Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has nine games with at least three touchdown passes and zero interceptions this season, the most in a season in NFL history (Elias Sports Bureau). He is currently on a three-game streak with those numbers. What to know for fantasy: Since 2018, Green Bay's Aaron Jones ranks fourth among qualified running backs in points per touch (1.08). He's running hard (6.1 yards per carry over his past three games) and is facing the fourth-worst defense in terms of defending running backs since the beginning of last season. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Green Bay is 4-0 against the spread (ATS) in prime-time games this season, and Carolina is 4-12 ATS in prime-time games since 2014 (0-1 ATS this season). Read more.",61.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Most of the time when the ""What's wrong with Matt Ryan"" question is raised, the Falcons quarterback follows up with a strong outing. His passer ratings the past five games (two of which were wins) have been 112.1, 45.8, 75.3, 80.4 and 57.3. That's all over the place. If Ryan wants to prove to Atlanta that he still has it and can be the guy next season, a strong rebound against Tampa Bay is the place to start. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: The Bucs will have three red zone stops on defense. They had two last weekend against the Vikings and three before the bye week against the Chiefs. And for all the positive changes coach Raheem Morris has made, the Falcons are still one of the worst red zone scoring teams on offense in the league, averaging just 48.9% in red zone touchdown efficiency (31st). Scoring for them is going to have to come from chunk plays downfield. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: In eight wins, Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady has been sacked five times and pressured on 13% of dropbacks while completing 44% of his passes thrown 20-plus yards downfield (four touchdowns, zero interceptions). But in losses, Brady has been pressured and struggled with the deep ball. In five losses this season, he was sacked 11 times, pressured on 27% of dropbacks and able to complete just 21% of passes 20-plus yards downfield (one TD and five interceptions). What to know for fantasy: Atlanta tight end Hayden Hurst has 12.4 fantasy points over his past four games. Total. It's not ideal, but the Buccaneers are allowing the fifth-most tight end points this season, allowing opponents to complete 73.2% of their tight-end targets (fifth highest) in the process. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Atlanta is 1-4 ATS against teams with winning records this season. Read more.",38.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Which team will handle the pressure applied by the opposing defense? Washington's front has been terrific, starting with Chase Young and Montez Sweat. Washington ranks third in sacks per pass attempt (9.1%) for the season, while the Seahawks rank first in that category since Week 8. Washington likes to play zone, which is wise against Seattle wideout DK Metcalf and quarterback Russell Wilson. Those two have combined for three plays of 50 yards or longer; Washington has allowed an NFL-high seven such receptions. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Wilson will complete at least 75% of his passes. He has hit that mark four times this season, including last weekend as the Seahawks' game plan against the Jets and their new defensive coordinator was to get the ball out quickly on shorter passes. Washington's loaded defensive line will give the Seahawks another reason to do that Sunday, especially if starting right tackle Brandon Shell is unavailable. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Over the past four weeks, Washington's defensive line leads NFL with 58 QB pressures and boasts the second-highest pass rush win rate, beating blocks within 2.5 seconds 61% of the time, per ESPN metrics and NFL Next Gen Stats. What to know for fantasy: Seattle receiver Tyler Lockett has been held under 12.5 fantasy points in six of seven games since his 53-point outburst against the Cardinals, and Washington owns the fourth-best defense against receivers this season. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Washington has covered in four consecutive games, all wins. Read more.",40.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Patriots are the NFL's fifth-best rushing offense (147.5 yards per game), and they leaned on that rushing for 217 yards (quarterback Cam Newton had 75) when they beat the Dolphins 21-11 in the season opener. Miami's rushing defense (120.2 yards per game allowed, 22nd in the NFL) has improved some since then, but the Dolphins know the key to stopping the Patriots' offense starts with minimizing the running attack. -- Cameron Wolfe Bold prediction: A trick play, with Newton on the receiving end, will provide a spark, as the Patriots need to pull out all the stops with their season on the line. Even though playoff hopes are a long shot, the Patriots will go all out to win, and the offense will need to get creative at times to jump-start an attack that produced only three points in a Week 14 loss to the Rams. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: The Dolphins have forced a turnover in 19 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NFL and the Dolphins' longest streak since a 19-game run in 1997-98. The most recent time Miami had a longer streak was in 1982-85 (42 straight). What to know for fantasy: Newton had a season-high 15 rushing attempts (75 yards and two scores) in the Week 1 meeting with the Dolphins. He scored 25.7 fantasy points in that game, but he has reached that mark just once since. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: This is the first time Miami has been favored over New England since 2013, and it's the first time Miami has been favored by more than one point over New England since 2003.

" What to watch for: Keep an eye on the Colts' pass rush facing the Texans' offensive line. The Colts were shut out when it came to sacks against the Raiders in Week 14, but Houston quarterbacks were sacked seven times by the Bears last weekend. Indianapolis sacked Texans QB Deshaun Watson five times when these teams met two weeks ago, and he Texans have given up 40 sacks this season. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Houston wide receiver Keke Coutee will have another game with 100 or more receiving yards. The three best games in Coutee's career have come against the Colts (a combined 22 catches for 275 yards), and that will continue on Sunday. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: Watson has 25 passing touchdowns this season, and he needs just two more to set a new career high. What to know for fantasy: Tyreek Hill, DK Metcalf and T.Y. Hilton are the only players this season to string together three straight games with 80 receiving yards and a touchdown catch, with Hilton being the one riding an active streak. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Indianapolis is 8-2 ATS in its past 10 games as a favorite. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: All eyes will be on Vikings kicker Dan Bailey after he missed three field goals and an extra point in a Week 14 loss to Tampa Bay. Coach Mike Zimmer was lukewarm on his commitment to Bailey this week, but given the COVID-19 protocols and Bailey's long history of being an excellent kicker, all signs point to Minnesota not making a change for the Bears game. But if Bailey misses a kick Sunday, I'm not so sure how much longer he'll be on the roster. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: The Bears will win their third straight game in Minnesota for the first time since 1983-85. Chicago coach Matt Nagy has had the Vikings' number at U.S. Bank Stadium, where his team has won each of the past two seasons, including a dominant victory in the 2018 regular-season finale that kept Minnesota out of the playoffs. Nagy is 4-1 lifetime versus the Vikings, the lone loss occurring when these teams met at Soldier Field on Nov. 16. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Minnesota running back Dalvin Cook has 14 rushing touchdowns this season, the second most in a single season in Vikings history (Adrian Peterson had 18 in 2009). But Cook has averaged 2.84 yards per rush in four career games against the Bears. What to know for fantasy: Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen scored twice in the first meeting with the Bears, but Justin Jefferson had twice as many receptions and caught 80% of his targets (Thielen was at 57.1%). See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Chicago is 1-4 ATS in its past five games. Read more.",54.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Quarterback Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' dominant rushing attack face a struggling Jaguars run defense. Baltimore leads the NFL in rushing (173.8 yards per game) and has produced over 200 yards on the ground in back-to-back games. Jacksonville has allowed the third-most rushing yards this season (145.5 per game) and gave up 249 last weekend to the Titans. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Yannick Ngakoue will have multiple sacks on Sunday. The Ravens defensive end said he's treating this as just another game, but nobody believes that, right? It was an ugly end to his time in Jacksonville, which included calling the owner's son (who is also the team's executive VP of football administration and technology) a clown on social media. Jaguars offensive tackles Cam Robinson and Jawaan Taylor have struggled against quicker rushers this season, and Ngakoue will take advantage. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: The Jaguars have lost 12 straight games, the second-longest losing streak in franchise history (13 straight in 2012-13). But on the upside, they have a plus-74 point differential against the Ravens and are 12-9 in the matchup's history. What to know for fantasy: Jacksonville running back James Robinson and Buffalo receiver Stefon Diggs are the only running backs, wide receivers or tight ends to have scored 10 PPR points in all 13 of their team's games this season. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Baltimore is 39-0 outright as a double-digit favorite in the regular season, the only team to never lose in that spot. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The quest for 2,000 rushing yards continues for Titans running back Derrick Henry, who has 1,532 yards with three games left. The Titans will try to take advantage of a Detroit run defense allowing 132.8 yards per game. They want to get Henry the football but will be cautious about running him too much. Keep an eye on how they manage his carries and how often he can break off longer runs. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Henry will put himself in a little bit better position for his chase for 2,000 yards after running for 200-plus yards against Detroit, including two touchdowns. The Lions' offense is matching their defense in terms of injuries, with questions about Frank Ragnow (throat) and Matthew Stafford (ribs), so Detroit's already-porous run defense might end up on the field more than it would want -- which could leave for large holes in the second half. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: The Lions have allowed 21 rushing touchdowns (tied for the most) this season. What to know for fantasy: Four of Henry's seven career games with 30 points have come in December (includes 36.2 points last weekend at Jacksonville). See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: When quarterback Ryan Tannehill starts regular-season games for Tennessee, overs are 18-4-1, including 9-3-1 this season. Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Cowboys' run defense can feel good about its performance against Cincinnati last weekend, allowing 101 yards on 30 carries, but in facing similar run schemes to what San Francisco uses, the unit has struggled majorly. The Browns ran for 307 yards against Dallas, the most allowed in team history. Washington ran for 189 and 182 yards in sweeping the Cowboys in 2020. Gap discipline is a must vs. San Francisco, but the Cowboys have yet to show the ability to be sound when facing a zone scheme. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: For the second time this season, 49ers running back Jeff Wilson Jr. will set a career high for rushing yards, surpassing the 112 he had against New England in Week 7. Dallas is giving up a league-worst 162.7 rushing yards per game and 5.07 yards per carry. With Raheem Mostert still dealing with the lingering effects of a previous ankle injury, this is a favorable matchup for Wilson and the Niners on the ground. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: San Francisco quarterback Nick Mullens has thrown seven interceptions since Week 8. Drew Lock (nine) and Matt Ryan (eight) are the only players who have more in the NFL over that span. What to know for fantasy: Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott has been held under 10 fantasy points eight times in his career, and five of them have come in the past two months. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Since the start of the 2018 season, Dallas is 4-0 ATS as a home underdog (1-0 ATS this season). Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Rams' offense has rebounded since a Week 12 loss to the 49ers, but watch for coach Sean McVay and quarterback Jared Goff to potentially try to open up the playbook and find connections deep downfield against a struggling Jets defense that is allowing 286.8 passing yards per game, which ranks 31st in the NFL. Entering Sunday, Goff is averaging 6.18 air yards per attempt, which ranks 33rd out 35 qualified passers. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald will record at least two sacks and at least two run stuffs (tackles for zero or negative yards). An elite interior pass-rusher each week, he now faces a team with two backup guards in Pat Elflein and Josh Andrews. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: The Rams lead the NFL in total defense (285.9 yards per game), while the Jets are last in total offense (269.8). What to know for fantasy: Los Angeles running back Cam Akers and Minnesota's Dalvin Cook are the only two players with 20 carries in each of the past two weeks. Not bad for a rookie who had 59 carries for the season prior. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Eight of past 10 Rams games have gone under the total. Read more.",41.5,LOW
" What to watch for: With running back Chase Edmonds a game-time decision and quarterback Kyler Murray having struggled in the run department recently, watch for Murray to break out on the ground against the Eagles. Murray understands the Cardinals' playoff situation -- they need to keep winning to stay alive -- and if he runs, they tend to have a better chance to win. With three games left, the Cardinals don't have any time to waste, and Murray will do his part. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Eagles running back Miles Sanders will rack up 70 receiving yards and record his first receiving TD of the season. His prowess as a pass-catcher, on display during his rookie season, faded for much of this year, as he and quarterback Carson Wentz had trouble connecting. Sanders posted a season-high 36 receiving yards last weekend with Jalen Hurts under center, signaling bigger things to come. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Murray is 9-4 in his career when rushing for 40-plus yards in a game. But he is 3-12-1 when held under that. What to know for fantasy: Sanders is coming off of his best game of the season (29.6 points), and there is home run upside. But it comes at a cost. Sanders has more single-digit performances (four) than 20-point games (three), with three of those duds coming in the past month. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Arizona is 3-6 ATS as a favorite with Murray under center. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It's two of the NFL's elite teams, both trying to secure the crucial No. 1 seed in their conferences. The Chiefs' No. 1-ranked offense meets the Saints' No. 2-ranked defense. Oh, and there's a chance that Drew Brees could return to the lineup just in time for an epic QB matchup against Patrick Mahomes. There might not be a better game on the NFL's regular-season schedule all year. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: The Chiefs will force the Saints into at least two game-altering turnovers. The suddenly revived Chiefs pass rush had four sacks against the Dolphins last weekend and will pressure the Saints' quarterback -- whether it's Brees or Taysom Hill -- into some mistakes. Keep an eye on Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu, who has four interceptions over the past three games. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Mahomes has thrown for at least 315 yards in six straight games, tied with Brees (2012-13) and Rich Gannon (2002) for the longest such streak in NFL history. And according to the Elias Sports Bureau, his 2,309 yards over his past six games is the most over any six-game span in NFL history. What to know for fantasy: Chiefs running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire has been held under 40 rushing yards in four of his past five games, and despite being a fantasy first-rounder, he has just two top-10 performances this season. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: Kansas City has won five consecutive one-score games, though it has failed to cover in all five. It is the first team to win but not cover five straight since the 1986 Patriots. Read more.",48.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Browns have the third-ranked rushing offense (156.2 yards per game), and the Giants have the seventh-ranked rushing defense (101.5). Whoever wins that matchup likely wins this game. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: In teammate and close friend Odell Beckham Jr.'s former stadium, Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry will account for multiple touchdowns in a game for the first time this season. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield has averaged 9.9 yards per attempt off play-action this season, second best in the NFL. But he has averaged 6.3 yards per attempt without play-action, 29th in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: There are 14 tight ends who have seen at least 55 targets this season, and Evan Engram of the Giants ranks last among them in points per target (1.22). In fact, that rate is 18.1% below any of the other qualifiers and 29.5% below the average. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: The Giants are 8-3 ATS as an underdog this season. Read more.",47.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Pittsburgh is trying to snap a two-game losing skid that has halted its momentum on the season. The Bengals have dropped five straight, have been decimated by injuries and are looking for their first victory over their AFC North rival since Nov. 1, 2015. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: The Steelers will rush for more than 100 yards. The running game has been nonexistent for three games, but Pittsburgh is facing a Bengals team that gives up 131.9 rushing yards per game. To go deep in the playoffs, the Steelers need a more well-balanced offense, and the Monday Night Football game will allow them to correct their shortcomings in the ground game. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: Drops have been a major issue for the Steelers this season. They have 33 total drops and a 6.3% drop rate, both highest in the NFL. And over the past three weeks, they have 14 drops and a 9.9% drop rate. Wide receiver Diontae Johnson leads all players with 11 drops, while tight end Eric Ebron is tied for the lead among tight ends with six. What to know for fantasy: Yes, quarterback Joe Burrow was calling the shots, but in the first Steelers-Bengals game, Cincinnati wide receiver Tee Higgins accounted for 54% of the team's receiving yards. See Week 15 rankings. Betting nugget: The largest upset in Monday Night Football history is 10.5 points, done three times, most recently by Miami at home against New England in 2017. Read more.",33.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bills ranked 15th in the NFL in sacks last season, while the Steelers protected QB Ben Roethlisberger better than any other team, allowing a league-low 14 sacks. But Buffalo revamped its defensive line this offseason, while Pittsburgh placed right tackle Zach Banner on IR last week and listed rookie Dan Moore Jr. as its starter at left tackle. Roethlisberger's jersey might not be so clean come Sunday. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Steelers running back Najee Harris will have more than 100 all-purpose yards. It's no small task to ask a rookie to carry a team's ground game, but taken in the first round in April, Harris is expected to do exactly that. His first test comes against a Bills team that struggled with missed tackles a season ago and had an average run defense. In 2020, the Steelers combined for 47 rushing yards on 2.8 yards per carry in their loss to the Bills, but as a dual-threat runner and pass-catcher, Harris should drastically elevate the Steelers' offense -- even with a work-in-progress offensive line. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: Bills QB Josh Allen set franchise records with 37 passing TDs and 4,544 passing yards, and his 25 rushing touchdowns over the past three seasons are the most among QBs and rank ninth among all players in that span. What to know for fantasy: Allen was a top-five fantasy quarterback a league-best nine times last season, but he draws a Steelers defense that was second best in limiting fantasy production by QBs. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Bills covered in six home games last season, matching their total from the two prior seasons combined. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Keep an eye on how Colts rookie defensive end Kwity Paye does against Seahawks left tackle Duane Brown. Paye, the No. 21 pick in this year's draft, dominated just about every offensive tackle he faced during training camp, but he'll be tested in his first NFL start. Brown is a four-time Pro Bowler who had the second-best pass block win rate among tackles last season. The Colts are trying to make up for losing a combined 15.5 sacks in Justin Houston and Denico Autry in the offseason. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: The Seahawks' offense will turn in a mixed-bag performance. There will be some moments that show how much potential it has with one of the NFL's best collections of skill players and a new scheme that can put defenses on their heels. But it's being coordinated by a first-time playcaller in Shane Waldron, it's facing a top-10 defense from last season and many of its starters -- including QB Russell Wilson -- didn't play a down in the preseason. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: The Seahawks are 12-1 with Wilson at QB in the Eastern time zone since the start of the 2018 season. And in those 13 games, Wilson has a Total QBR of 83, 26 TDs, five interceptions and a 72% completion percentage. What to know for fantasy: Colts running back Jonathan Taylor ranked second in percentage of runs gaining at least 10 yards last season (15.1%), but he has a tough matchup against a Seahawks front that ranked among the top eight in yards per carry allowed both before and after contact last season. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past two seasons, the Seahawks are 8-2 outright as road favorites but just 3-6-1 against the spread (ATS) in those games. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: It's finally time for the Titans to see how quickly QB Ryan Tannehill and wide receiver Julio Jones are able to get on the same page after limited reps together in camp. Jones against any of the Cardinals' corners is an obvious mismatch -- and the same can be said about receiver A.J. Brown's matchups. Tannehill isn't one to lock in on a particular receiver, so it will be interesting to see how he goes about distributing the football to his two premier playmakers. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: There will be a lot of yards gained by a lot of players Sunday in Nissan Stadium. Arizona's DeAndre Hopkins and A.J. Green, and Tennessee's Jones and Brown will all have 100 yards receiving in the opener, and Titans running back Derrick Henry will rush for 150 yards. Both offenses will showcase what they can do and all their shiny new players, but they'll both be exhausted by the end of the game. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: Jones and Hopkins love Week 1; they are tied for the most receiving touchdowns in the opening week of play among all currently rostered players with seven apiece (Larry Fitzgerald has nine). What to know for fantasy: Henry has never had a carry gain more than 25 yards in the first month of a season. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: All eight of Arizona's road games went under the total last season. But the over is 21-4-1 for Tennessee in the regular season in Tannehill's starts since he joined the team. Read more.",67.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Chargers' offensive line hold Washington's defensive front? Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert was sacked 32 times last season, tied for ninth most in the NFL, while Washington recorded 47 sacks, tied for sixth best. And 34 of those came from a defensive line that welcomes back its best interior rusher in Matt Ioannidis and has two top young defensive ends in Chase Young and Montez Sweat. Los Angeles revamped its line with four new starters -- including rookie tackle Rashawn Slater -- but will it be enough? -- John Keim Bold prediction: Yes, Washington has a defensive front that Herbert said ""is about as good as it gets."" But the Chargers' revamped offensive line has something to prove. Expect it to keep Herbert clean and allow him to throw for more than 350 yards and three touchdowns on Sunday. -- Shelley Smith Stat to know: Washington QB Ryan Fitzpatrick will be starting for his ninth different team. According to the Elias Sports Bureau research, he was already the first player (not just quarterback) to start for eight different teams since at least 1933. The only other QB to throw a pass for eight different teams is Josh McCown. What to know for fantasy: Washington tight end Logan Thomas lined up in the slot on 44.2% of his snaps last season and faces a Chargers defense that allowed the third-most yards per slot pass attempt in 2020 (8.8). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Last season, Washington ranked second in fourth-quarter point differential (plus-69), while the Chargers ranked 31st (minus-50). Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Bengals QB Joe Burrow will be making his official return from a season-ending knee injury in 2020. He'll try to exploit a Minnesota secondary that surrendered big passing plays in 2020, while Vikings running back Dalvin Cook will look to exploit the Bengals' run defense. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: Minnesota's overhauled secondary will struggle against Burrow, whose accuracy and ability to scramble will lead him to three passing touchdowns, keeping this game close until the final moments. Vikings' kicker Greg Joseph, who hasn't kicked in a game since the end of the 2019 season, will nail a 50-plus-yarder to lift Minnesota past Cincinnati. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: The Vikings allowed 40.0 points per game in their final three 2020 games, but they haven't allowed 30-plus points in four consecutive games since the 2012-13 seasons. What to know for fantasy: Cook had one weakness last season, and that was his 3.7 yards per carry on up-the-gut runs, a rate that ranked 30th of 47 qualifiers. Well, the 5.2 yards per carry that Cincinnati allowed to RBs on such runs last season wasn't just a league high, it was the most by an AFC defense since the 2012 Bills. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Bengals were just 1-7-1 outright with Burrow starting, but they did manage to cover five of those contests. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It's truly a new era in Detroit, with Jared Goff set to become the first quarterback outside of Matthew Stafford to start a season opener since 2008. There aren't many expectations for Detroit to win more than five regular-season games, so players seem to be embracing an underdog role this season. Lions tight end T.J. Hockenson is close friends with and a former college teammate of the 49ers' George Kittle, so that'll be a matchup to watch for bragging rights at the position. -- Eric Woodyard Bold prediction: Much of the talk about the Niners going into this one centers on the quarterbacks, but it will be the run game -- led by back Raheem Mostert -- that will steal the show. Mostert will run for 150-plus yards and a pair of touchdowns against a Detroit defense that finished 28th in rushing yards allowed per game and gave up a league-high 27 rushing touchdowns in 2020, and then didn't make many significant moves to improve in that area in the offseason. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: The 49ers are 15-2 against the Lions dating back to 1988, the best record by a team versus a single opponent in that span (minimum 10 meetings). What to know for fantasy: The highest-scoring career debut by a non-QB last season was 21.3 points from Bills running back Antonio Williams. That number could be within reach for Niners RB Trey Sermon against a Lions defense that allowed a league-high 32.5 fantasy points per game to the position last season. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past decade, road teams favored by at least seven points win outright 83% of the time but are just 87-88-3 ATS. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This is the debut for both head coaches -- Arthur Smith with Atlanta, and Nick Sirianni with Philadelphia -- and it has led to a bit of scheme mystery for both teams. Neither the Eagles nor Falcons showed much of their offenses or defenses during training camp. ""The advantages that I think we have is that they don't know what we're going to do and we don't know what they're going to do,"" Sirianni said. ""So just kind of a blank slate right there."" -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Eagles cornerback Darius Slay will record his third career interception against quarterback Matt Ryan, sparking a bounce-back year. Ryan had an abysmal day the last time these two faced off, throwing three picks -- two to Slay -- in a 2017 matchup between the Falcons and Detroit Lions. Slay, 30, is focused on generating more takeaways this season after posting just one interception in 2020. Playing in defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon's takeaway-obsessed scheme should help. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: At 23 years and 36 days old, Philadelphia QB Jalen Hurts will surpass Carson Wentz and Donovan McNabb as the youngest Eagles season-opening starter in the Super Bowl era. Both Wentz and McNabb won those openers, and while Hurts was 1-3 as the starting QB last season, the Eagles averaged 382.0 yards per game in his starts as opposed to 318.8 in Wentz's starts. What to know for fantasy: Falcons receiver Calvin Ridley led the NFL in air yards last season with 2,042, and he faces an Eagles defense that didn't turn over the opposition on deep passes last season (2% deep interception rate, fourth lowest). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Eagles were just 1-7, both outright and ATS, on the road last season. Read more.",59.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: This is all about former Jets quarterback Sam Darnold -- now starting with the Panthers -- and new Jets quarterback Zach Wilson. Whomever gets the best protection and is the most efficient will come out ahead, and both defensive coordinators will aim to get the opposing quarterbacks out of their comfort zones. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey will have double-digit receptions for the 11th time in his career. He will be a matchup nightmare for the Jets, who don't have anyone who can cover him. C.J. Mosley isn't great in coverage, and the other linebackers are rookies. New York could try using safety Lamarcus Joyner, who has experience as a slot corner. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: This is the first instance of a top-three-drafted QB starting his first NFL game against another selected by the same franchise. What to know for fantasy: Since Week 14 of 2019, McCaffrey has six games with at least 24.5 fantasy points, a number that trails only Derrick Henry at the position over that stretch. And McCaffrey has played in only seven of those 21 weeks. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: No team covered fewer games in the first half of last season than the Jets, but only four teams (Bills, Saints, Ravens and Dolphins) covered more in the second portion of the season. Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can rookie quarterback Trevor Lawrence find success against a depleted Texans secondary? Houston was already going to be without cornerback Bradley Roby (he is finishing out his six-game suspension in Week 1) but also has injury concerns with safety Lonnie Johnson. Johnson, who is dealing with a thigh injury, did not practice Wednesday. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: Texans QB Tyrod Taylor will throw for fewer than 200 yards. He has made two previous starts against the Jaguars and hasn't thrown for more than 166 yards in them. The last time he started a game against the Jaguars came in the 2017 playoffs, and he threw for just 134 yards in a 10-3 loss. The Jaguars have rebuilt their secondary with the addition of defensive backs Shaquill Griffin, Tyson Campbell, Rayshawn Jenkins and Andre Cisco, and defensive coordinator Joe Cullen likes to call a lot of blitzes, so the Jaguars should make it a tough day for Taylor. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: A few not-so-great streaks are in play here. The Jaguars have lost a franchise-record 15 straight games, which is tied for the 10th-longest losing streak since the NFL merger in 1970. They also have 18 straight games allowing at least 20 points, tied for the fifth-longest streak since 1970. The Texans, meanwhile, have lost four straight season openers, tied with Giants for the second-longest active streak in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Since 2016, only Mike Evans and Julio Jones have more deep receptions than Texans receiver Brandin Cooks, who lines up against a Jags defense that allowed the fifth-most yards per deep completion last season (28.8). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: This is just the third time in the past 15 seasons that Jacksonville has been a road favorite in a division game, and it's the first time since 2017. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Chiefs will start two rookies and a first-year player (Lucas Niang opted out in 2020) on their offensive line, but no member of that group will be under more scrutiny than veteran Orlando Brown Jr., who makes his Kansas City debut at left tackle against the Browns' Myles Garrett. The Chiefs' rebuilt offensive line, with five new starters from last season, showed well in the preseason but faces a bigger challenge against Garrett and the Browns. In his one start at left tackle for the Ravens against the Browns last season, Brown held Garrett without a sack, one of the four games in which Garrett was shut out. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: In his return, Browns receiver Odell Beckham Jr. will catch two touchdown passes from QB Baker Mayfield. It might not be enough against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, but Cleveland's offense can take away plenty of confidence about its potential for the rest of the season. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: The Browns have not won a season-opener since 2004, when QB Jeff Garcia led them to a 20-3 win over the Ravens. The closest they've come was a 21-21 tie against the Steelers in 2018. It's easily the longest winless streak in season openers of all time. But the Browns made a habit of breaking bad streaks last season, including their 12 straight seasons without a winning record and 17 straight seasons out of the playoffs. What to know for fantasy: Cleveland's Nick Chubb was RB5 in total points over the final six weeks of last season, and he shouldn't have a problem finishing drives against 2020's worst red zone defense. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Chiefs were 11-5 ATS in 2019 (12-4 outright). But Vegas adjusted properly last season, as Kansas City was just 7-9 ATS despite a sparkling 14-2 outright record. Read more.",58.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Saints will have to deal with a ton of adjustments in this game, from their temporary ""home"" venue in Jacksonville, Florida, in the wake of Hurricane Ida to at least 10 new starters in the lineup because of injuries, retirements and an offseason salary-cap purge. But none will be bigger than the switch at quarterback from Drew Brees to Jameis Winston, who will try to revive his career by proving he can still make big plays while avoiding the big mistakes that doomed him in Tampa Bay. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: This will turn into a quasi-home game for the Packers, and that will play right into QB Aaron Rodgers' hands. He'll draw the Saints offsides with his cadence more than once, and at least one of them will turn into a big play down the field -- just like the one he had last year against the Saints in a crowd-free Superdome, where on a free play he drew a pass interference penalty that set up the Packers' last score to seal the game. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: Saints running back Alvin Kamara had career highs in scrimmage yards (197), receiving yards (139) and receiving TDs (2) in Week 3 against Packers last season. What to know for fantasy: Winston found receiver Marquez Callaway for touchdowns of 29 and 43 yards in New Orleans' final preseason game. The Packers gave up a 31-yard passing TD in their preseason finale and allowed a WR1 in Week 1 last season to rack up 110 yards and two scores (Adam Thielen). See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: The Saints covered in Week 1 last season, the first time they had done that since 2013 and just the fifth time in the 15-year Sean Payton era. Read more.",51.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Everyone knows the Tua Tagovailoa vs. Mac Jones storyline, but we shouldn't overlook the key factors that could lead to each of their success. Dolphins starting left tackle Austin Jackson spent the week on the reserve/COVID-19 list, which means he might not play. That could create a decisive matchup advantage for Patriots outside linebackers Matt Judon and Kyle Van Noy, two of the team's best defenders. Judon and other members of the Patriots' D have remarked how they want to lighten the load for Jones by doing their part. ""Mac has a lot on his plate right now,"" Judon said. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: The Dolphins' defense led the league in turnovers forced last season and will rudely welcome Jones to the NFL this year, holding him under 220 passing yards with a pair of interceptions. On the other side of the ball, rookie receiver Jaylen Waddle will record 75 total yards and his first career touchdown. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: Tagovailoa and Jones will be the first matchup between NFL starting QBs who played for coach Nick Saban in college (both at Alabama). Miami's Tagovailoa can become the youngest visiting QB to win at Gillette Stadium, where starting QBs age-23 or younger are 1-20. Jones, meanwhile, will become first rookie QB to start Week 1 under Pats coach Bill Belichick. What to know for fantasy: Opponents were on-target with 93.9% of their passes when targeting running backs against New England last season (second highest), and Dolphins running back Myles Gaskin closed out his 2020 campaign with a 30-plus-yard reception in three straight games. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past two seasons, quarterbacks making their first career start are 18-6 ATS. Read more.",38.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Broncos star pass-rusher Von Miller faces Giants right tackle Nate Solder, and both players have not played since 2019. Miller missed all of last year with an ankle injury, while Solder opted out of the season. Does Miller still have it? He's 32 years old, coming off major injury and had 8.0 sacks in his last full season. The same question could be asked of Solder. He was ranked 35th in pass block win rate among tackles the last time we saw him play. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: The Broncos forced zero turnovers in each of their past two season openers and lost both games. But they will force at least two in this one to end that streak. Helping the cause: Giants QB Daniel Jones has 39 turnovers since entering the NFL in 2019, the most in the NFL over that time. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: The Giants have lost nine of their past 10 season openers, and they averaged just 17.5 points per game last season, the second fewest in the NFL behind the Jets' 15.2. What to know for fantasy: In each of Broncos QB Teddy Bridgewater's final five games last season (with Carolina), he produced a top-20 fantasy receiver. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Underdogs were 38-28 ATS last season when the over/under was fewer than 45 points. Read more.",39.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Both teams open the 2021 season with new quarterbacks. The Rams completed an offseason blockbuster trade for Matthew Stafford, who is expected to ignite an offense that has been in decline over the past two seasons with the hope of a Super Bowl run. ""He has done such a good job getting acclimated to his teammates, this environment, this atmosphere,"" Rams coach Sean McVay said. For the Bears, Andy Dalton, who was acquired as a free agent on a one-year deal, will start over rookie Justin Fields, the 11th-overall draft pick this year. ""Andy has come in here from the start and been a great leader and been a great teammate,"" Bears coach Matt Nagy said, adding that he feels good about what Fields has exemplified in a short period. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Rams superstar Aaron Donald will end the night with 2.5 sacks. The Bears' offensive line dealt with too many moving parts in the preseason; four of the five original projected starters on the offensive line will play on Sunday night, but chemistry figures to be an issue. Throw in the fact that 39-year-old veteran Jason Peters, whom the Bears signed late in camp, is starting at left tackle. And have we mentioned that Dalton isn't the most mobile quarterback. Advantage: Donald. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Bears running back David Montgomery ended last season with six straight games with a scrimmage touchdown, tied for the longest active streak in the NFL (Nick Chubb, J.K. Dobbins). The last Bears player with seven straight games with a TD was Curtis Conway in 1995. What to know for fantasy: Only the Jets allowed more fantasy points to tight ends last season than the Bears, and the Rams' Tyler Higbee is poised to step into a greater role with Gerald Everett now in Seattle. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: No team had more outright wins as an underdog than the Bears last season (six). Read more.",41.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How will the Raiders' rebuilt defense stop Baltimore QB Lamar Jackson, especially with a pair of linebackers added in the past two weeks in Denzel Perryman and K.J. Wright? Las Vegas linebacker Cory Littleton lamented, ""He can throw. He can run. He can do magic tricks, apparently."" The Ravens' injury-plagued running game actually makes Jackson more one-dimensional, but knowing it and stopping it are two different things for the Raiders. Containing Jackson and limiting his big-play potential could be the difference. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: Jackson will continue his hot start to seasons by totaling five touchdowns (four passing and one rushing). Jackson has scored the most touchdowns (eight) in the past two openers. And the Raiders allowed 106 touchdowns last season, the second most in the league. -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: Raiders QB Derek Carr is 4-2 as a starting QB on Monday Night Football but has struggled in those games, posting the fifth-lowest Total QBR (46.0) on MNF over past 10 seasons (minimum five starts). What to know for fantasy: Baltimore tight end Mark Andrews ended the 2020 regular season with seven scores in his final seven games and has been a top-three tight end in each of the past two opening weeks. See Week 1 rankings. Betting nugget: Baltimore has covered five straight regular-season games as a favorite, but Las Vegas has covered four of its past five games as an underdog. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Dolphins have yet to solve Josh Allen over the course of his career. In six career games, Allen is 5-1 against Miami with 1,552 passing yards, 17 touchdowns and just four interceptions. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Allen will throw at least three touchdown passes, and the Bills' offense will get back on track. For whatever reason, Allen has had the most career success against the Dolphins. He has thrown for at least three TD passes in four of six games against Miami and has averaged 8.7 yards per attempt in those six games. Miami's defense, especially the secondary, could cause issues for the Bills, but the Dolphins won't be able to replicate the Steelers' pass rush. -- Alaina Getzenberg Stat to know: Since last season's Week 2 game at Miami, Allen's QBR is 78, which ranks third behind Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes. Allen also has thrown more touchdown passes in 16 starts (36) than he did in 28 starts (32) before that game. What to know for fantasy: Wideout Stefon Diggs had 15.9 fantasy points -- nine catches for 69 yards -- in the Bills' Week 1 loss to Pittsburgh. Now, he'll line up against Miami corner Xavien Howard, who allowed just 23 yards on four targets as the nearest defender last week, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. See Week 2 rankings.

" What to watch for: Aaron Donald vs. Quenton Nelson. It's the NFL's best interior defensive lineman against the league's best guard. Nelson, an All-Pro in each of his first three seasons in the league, will have his hands full -- and might need help, at times -- against Donald, a three-time Defensive Player of the Year. ""Every team schemes for a player like Aaron Donald,"" Colts coach Frank Reich said. ""You can't scheme for him on every play because he's not at the same spot every play. ... He moves around. We have to be able to make some in-game adjustments."" -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: Quarterback Matthew Stafford will throw for more than 300 yards and four touchdown passes in a dominant offensive performance. Stafford is coming off a huge Week 1 performance that saw him pass for 321 yards and three touchdowns, with no interceptions, in a 20-point win over the Bears. The Colts' secondary proved suspect in Week 1, allowing the Seahawks to pass for four touchdowns. Watch for Rams coach Sean McVay to dial up the passing game once again on Sunday. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: Stafford hasn't started a season 2-0 since 2017. If he gets at least 317 passing yards against the Colts, he will have the most passing yards through the first two games of a season in his career. What to know for fantasy: Colts running back Jonathan Taylor has a touchdown -- or the fantasy equivalent of a touchdown (six points) -- as a pass-catcher in each of his past seven games. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Rams are 19-13 on the road since the McVay era began in 2017. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Panthers quarterback Sam Darnold was sacked only once but hit seven times by an average Jets defensive front. Now, he has to go up against a strong Saints front that sacked Aaron Rodgers twice, hit him seven times and forced three interceptions. Darnold himself said Saints DE Cameron Jordan can ""wreck a game.'' How well Darnold handles duress will be key for Carolina keeping pace. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Cornerback Bradley Roby will have an interception in his Saints debut after arriving in a trade from Houston last week. The Saints' defense has taken the next-man-up mentality to the next level early this season, dominating despite several key players missing from last season. And they might need to do it again, with top CB Marshon Lattimore now dealing with a thumb injury. New Orleans' secondary will be tested by Carolina's dynamic receivers, which will be a key to this matchup. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Jameis Winston looks to lead the Saints to their first 2-0 start since 2013. In 10 career starts vs Panthers, he has a Total QBR of 40. What to know for fantasy: Alvin Kamara has scored north of 19 fantasy points in five straight games against the Panthers, getting at least 20 touches of multiple touchdowns in each of those contests. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Saints covered every game last season that went under the total (six), making them the only team in the league to do so. In Week 1, they covered easily, and the under once again cashed. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: This matchup is all about the explosive plays. Philadelphia's defense did not allow a single pass play of 20 or more yards in Week 1 against the Falcons, while the Niners' offense was third in explosive pass plays against the Lions with five. Eagles corner Darius Slay likened 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel to a faster Anquan Boldin and said the key to success against such a dynamic offense is to read its keys and stay disciplined. -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: 49ers running back Elijah Mitchell will go over 100 rushing yards for the second straight week to begin his rookie season. The sixth-round pick was a relative unknown a week ago, then he set a record for rushing yards (104) by a Niner in his debut, against the Lions. The Eagles should be a bit better slowing the run than Detroit was, but this is a defense that looks vulnerable at the second level, which could make them susceptible to Mitchell's one-cut-and-go ability. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: Samuel had a career-high 189 receiving yards in Week 1. If he reaches 100 yards against the Eagles, he would have the most receiving yards in the first two games of the season by a 49ers player in team history. What to know for fantasy: From 2017 to 2020, the 49ers ranked fourth in running back fantasy points. Coach Kyle Shanahan manages a running back fantasy factory and will have to work more magic with Raheem Mostert out for the foreseeable future. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Jimmy Garoppolo is 8-4 against the spread in regular-season road starts since 2019. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Steelers confused Josh Allen and the Bills' offense with their defensive versatility, moving safety Minkah Fitzpatrick all around the field. Look for them to weaponize versatility again with guys such as Fitzpatrick, Cam Sutton, Tre Norwood. And keep an eye on outside linebackers Melvin Ingram III, T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith trying to minimize tight end Darren Waller -- a player who certainly has their attention after 19 targets a week ago. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Maxx Crosby and Watt will repeat their respective opening-week performances and both get two more sacks apiece. The Raiders' and Steelers' offensive lines are works in progress, but Crosby is coming off AFC Defensive Player of the Week honors, while the ink on Watt's four-year, $112 million extension is still wet. Oh, to be a young pass-rusher in this game. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: The past four meetings between these teams were decided by exactly three points. There have been only two series in NFL history featuring five straight games decided by exactly three points. Also, keep an eye on Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger; he needs three passing touchdowns to become the eighth NFL player with 400 passing touchdowns. What to know for fantasy: Steelers wideout Chase Claypool's ceiling captures headlines, but after Week 1, he has now failed to score more than 10 fantasy points in five of his past seven games. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Steelers have had just one losing ATS season at home since 2010 (3-5 ATS at home in 2017). Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will Houston quarterback Tyrod Taylor perform in his return to Cleveland? Baker Mayfield, who took over for Taylor as a rookie during the 2018 season, praised Taylor for his leadership and mentorship this week. Taylor would probably love nothing more than to show Mayfield another thing or two on Sunday.  -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: The Browns hold the Texans to fewer than 50 rushing yards. Taking out Taylor's four carries for 40 yards, Houston ran for 120 yards on 37 carries in Week 1 (3.2 yards per carry) against Jacksonville. But it's hard to see the game playing out the same way, and if the Texans are playing from behind for most of the tilt, it's easy to see how Cleveland's front seven dominates Houston's backs. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: The Browns did not lose consecutive games last season. And they haven't started 0-2 in a season since 2017. On the flipside, the Texans won consecutive games only once last season, and they have not started a season 2-0 since 2016. What to know for fantasy: Including the playoffs, Kareem Hunt has scored five times in his past five games. (He scored 13 times in his first 24 games with the Browns.) See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Baker Mayfield is just 4-8 ATS over his past 12 starts. Fantasy managers should take note, however, if you think the Browns will cover this week; in those four games, Mayfield has completed 73.9% of his passes for an average of 289 yards. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Here come the rookie quarterbacks. Zach Wilson and Mac Jones, coming off encouraging openers, meet for the first time in what should be a long personal rivalry. This is a new feel for the Patriots-Jets series, which was dominated by a veteran quarterback (Tom Brady) for two decades. The Jets have cycled through a handful of rookies over the years, but Jones is the Patriots' first rookie starter since Drew Bledsoe in 1993. It's the first time in the 62-year history of the rivalry that rookie QBs are starting against each other. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: The Patriots will make running back J.J. Taylor active as a result of rookie Rhamondre Stevenson's struggles in the opener, and Taylor's presence as a complement to Damien Harris and James White will be key against a Jets defense that blitzed 41.7% of the time in the opening week -- the fifth-highest total in the NFL. Also, Jones will throw multiple touchdown passes and continue to refuse to keep the footballs when teammates attempt to hand them to him. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: The last time a rookie quarterback beat the Patriots was ... Miami's Tua Tagovailoa last season in Week 15. The Patriots, however, were 9-0 in nine previous such games. What to know for fantasy: Corey Davis was WR16 for an extended stretch last season (Weeks 8 to 15), and he showed out last week with 26.7 points against the Panthers. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The over cashed in both Patriots-Jets games last season after being a winning ticket just once in the four seasons prior. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Jaguars' offensive tackles struggled last season, with Cam Robinson and Jawaan Taylor combining to allow 27 sacks, per ESPN Stats & Information research. The duo got off to a solid start against Houston, but this week will be significantly harder. Even if Bradley Chubb doesn't play or is limited, Von Miller will be hard to handle. Expect the Jaguars to keep tight end Chris Manhertz in to help the tackles. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: The Broncos' defense will have six combined sacks and turnovers. Denver won't load up on the blitzes against Jaguars rookie quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and while the Broncos certainly see Lawrence's obvious talents, he will face of a variety of four-man pressures backed by a variety of coverage looks from Vic Fangio's defense. And if the Broncos keep the Jaguars in difficult down-and-distance situations, Lawrence could have a tough time finding room to work. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Jacksonville, dating back to last season, is on the verge of losing 17 straight games, which would be tied for the fourth-longest losing streak since the merger in 1970. The Jags have allowed at least 20 points in each game of the skid. What to know for fantasy: Jacksonville running back James Robinson scored at least 10 fantasy points in every game last season as an unknown resource. He let managers down with just 8.4 points in Week 1, and he faces a Broncos team this week that held Saquon Barkley to 26 yards on 10 carries last weekend. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Teddy Bridgewater is 22-3 ATS on the road as a starter, but one of his rare losses against the spread came in Week 2 of last season at Tampa Bay, when he played for the Panthers. Read more.",43.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Justin Fields is always the center of attention. The Bears rookie quarterback played five snaps and scored a rushing touchdown in Chicago's Week 1 loss to the Rams. What will Fields do for an encore? The entire city of Chicago is on edge over the Bears. Veteran starter Andy Dalton -- formerly of the Bengals -- will need to play exceptionally well to hold onto the job. Even that might not be enough to fend off Fields. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: The Bengals will have two wide receivers with at least 75 receiving yards, and look for the Cincinnati to attack the right sideline. Chicago surrendered four completions for 138 yards and a touchdown down the right sideline against the Rams, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: The Bengals have the NFL's worst road record of 3-20-1 (.146) since 2018. Quarterback Joe Burrow is looking for the first road win of his career; he is 0-5-1 with a Total QBR of 45 in six career road starts. What to know for fantasy: Think the Bears, a three-point favorite, will win this game? In Chicago's final three wins of 2020, David Montgomery averaged 146 total yards per game on his way to 24.6 fantasy points per game. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Chicago quarterback Andy Dalton is 10-19 ATS in his past 29 starts. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Sure, all eyes will be on Kyler Murray just because of his unpredictability and excitement levels. But the most important aspect to watch on Sunday is how the Cardinals' front seven pressures the Vikings' offensive line and whether it can get to Kirk Cousins, who threw for 351 yards and two touchdowns last week. If the Cards' defense plays like it did in Tennessee, and Chandler Jones goes for another few sacks, then Minnesota's offense will be stuck in the mud, much like the Titans' was. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Jones and J.J. Watt will each get two sacks. Penalties won't hurt Minnesota's offense like they did in Week 1; that responsibility belongs to the Cardinals' defensive front, which will wreak havoc against the Vikings' struggling O-line. Unlike the Titans, Minnesota will attempt to help its tackles against Jones, but it won't be enough. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: Murray threw for a career-high four touchdown passes in Week 1 versus the Titans, with three of those coming on third down. He is the first Cardinals player with four pass touchdowns and a rushing score in a game since 1962 (Charley Johnson). What to know for fantasy: Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen has seen an end zone target in nine straight games. (He has nine touchdowns over that run.) See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Unders are 10-2-1 in Arizona games played in the first month of the season since 2018. Read more.",49.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: It's rare that a team manages to come away with a victory being minus-three in the turnover margin, but the Buccaneers did that against the Cowboys in Week 1. Cutting down on those mistakes against Atlanta will be key. On the other side of things, how long will Falcons coach Arthur Smith stick with the run against the league's top-ranked run defense over the past two years? Especially since the Cowboys didn't need it last week after getting chunk plays through the air against a Tampa Bay secondary that had issues tackling. The Bucs also will be without starting cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: Matt Ryan will have a 300-yard, three-touchdown day against Tampa Bay -- but it still results in a loss. The Falcons will find a way to get on track offensively; Ryan had 621 yards and five touchdowns in two games against the Buccaneers last season. But Tom Brady will have a 300-yard day of his own to counteract Atlanta's offensive discovery and send the Falcons to 0-2. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Brady has a career record of 8-0 against the Falcons -- including a win in Super Bowl LI. According to Elias Sports Bureau, Brady looks to become the sixth QB to go 9-0 or better against a single team since starts were first tracked in 1950. What to know for fantasy: Playoffs included, wideout Antonio Brown has run more than 25 routes eight times in his Buccaneers career, including last week with 36 routes. Tampa has won five of those games, and AB has found the end zone in all five. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Weeks 8 and 9 last season were the last time Tampa Bay failed to cover consecutive games (playoffs included). Read more.",57.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert will be looking for Austin Ekeler through the air this week after the running back didn't have a catch in Week 1. Los Angeles coach Brandon Staley has said the team needs to work Ekeler into the passing game. On the other side, the Cowboys need a big day from their offense to avoid an 0-2 start. -- Shelley Smith Bold prediction: Dak Prescott will not throw for 400 yards. Not bold enough? In the past four games that he has started and finished, he has thrown for at least 403 yards. He is the first player in league history with four 400-yard games in a five-game span. He has eight 400-yard passing games since 2016, most in the NFL. But the Cowboys are just 1-3 in those four games and know that is not a long-term formula for success. Maybe he throws for just 399 yards instead. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: The Cowboys are looking to avoid their first 0-2 start since 2010; the only time they have started 0-2 with both games on the road was in 1989. And while the Chargers have won the past three games versus Dallas, they are 0-3 against Mike McCarthy-led teams. What to know for fantasy: The Cowboys are a three-point underdog, so Prescott managers have their opponent right where they want them. In his past three losses, Prescott is averaging 57.7 passes and 30.7 fantasy points per game. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Chargers covered their final two home games of 2020 after failing to cover seven of their previous nine games at their place. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Seattle's defense must be licking its chops after watching the Titans allow six sacks in their blowout loss to Arizona in Week 1. The Seahawks got to Carson Wentz early and often in their opener. Now, their pass-rushers will have the added advantage of the crowd noise at Lumen Field, which could be as loud as ever with fans in attendance for the first time in a regular-season game since December 2019. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: The Titans will score a touchdown on their first drive. That's saying a lot considering how Tennessee gained a total of only four yards on their first four drives last week. The Seahawks are playing in their 2021 home opener at Lumen Field, where they allowed opposing offenses to score a touchdown on the opening drive only twice last season. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Titans have allowed more than 35 points in their past three regular-season games. And with Russell Wilson putting on a four-touchdown performance in Week 1, it is entirely possible that Titans streak continues. Wilson followed up the 2020 opener with five passing touchdowns in consecutive games. What to know for fantasy: In the Titans' past five losses (playoffs included), Derrick Henry has touched the ball 100 times but has not scored once. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The Titans have failed to cover three straight regular-season games twice in the past calendar year (includes an active streak). Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Patrick Mahomes has diced up the Ravens' defense in three meetings, with the Chiefs averaging 31.3 points per game. Baltimore's defense looked vulnerable Monday night, when it allowed 33 points in Las Vegas. But the Ravens have never given up more than 30 points in each of their first two games of a season. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Mahomes will complete six throws of at least 20 yards. Those plays are always there for him against a Ravens team that blitzes a lot but leaves itself vulnerable to big throws. He has 16 such plays in three career starts against the Ravens, who come into this game with a depleted secondary. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Mahomes and Lamar Jackson have the two highest Total QBRs among quarterbacks to appear in 10-plus prime-time games since the metric began in 2006. Mahomes has an eight-game winning streak in prime-time contests, the longest active streak of any quarterback. Jackson is 0-3 in his career versus the Chiefs, largely due to accuracy issues, failing to complete 55% of his passes in any of those three matchups. What to know for fantasy: Chiefs wideout Tyreek Hill has 310.6 fantasy points over his past 12 games (playoffs included). How good is that? Texas wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins had 287.8 points in 16 games last season. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: Mahomes is 8-3 ATS for his career in September. Read more.",50.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will the Lions try to defend Aaron Rodgers and the Packers' offense? The Saints blitzed him just twice and focused their efforts on taking away Davante Adams & Co. Will that serve as a blueprint for future opponents? What the Lions do -- and how well they do it -- might help determine what kind of coverages Rodgers sees throughout the season. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: The Lions will pull off their first upset of the Dan Campbell and Jared Goff era. Yes, the odds of this happening are slim, but I'll pick Detroit to win at Lambeau Field against a vulnerable Green Bay team. Detroit's running back duo of D'Andre Swift and Jamaal Williams will give the Packers problems, since most teams in the NFC North aren't used to facing a Lions team with a solid ground game. -- Eric Woodyard Stat to know: The Packers' offense was bad in Week 1, but maybe there's a silver lining. In two games following a 25-point loss under coach Matt Lafleur, Rodgers has thrown four touchdown passes in each. What to know for fantasy: Rodgers had no touchdown passes and two interceptions Week 1 at the Saints. He has never had back-to-back games with zero passing TDs as a starter. See Week 2 rankings. Betting nugget: The over hit in all three divisional games at Lambeau last season (1-4 in the other five regular-season games Green Bay hosted). Read more.",39.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Chargers QB Justin Herbert carved up the Chiefs twice last season, throwing for more than 300 yards in each game and combining for four touchdown passes with one interception. He might find the going even easier this time around against a Chiefs defense that is allowing opponents to complete 72% of their passes and is winning in the pass rush at a league-low rate of 26.2%. The Chiefs need a big game from pass-rushers Chris Jones and Frank Clark, or it could be a long day. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: Herbert will bounce back in a big way with more than 350 passing yards and multiple touchdowns -- and a win. He had an off game last week against Dallas, throwing only one touchdown pass with two interceptions. But if last season's games against the Chiefs are any indication of what is to come, this bold prediction is a safe bet. -- Shelley Smith Stat to know: Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes boasts a 16-2 record as a starter in division games over his NFL career, with 35 TD passes to just eight interceptions in those games. Since Total QBR was first tracked in 2006, Mahomes is one of three QBs with a 70-plus career QBR in division play, ahead of Peyton Manning and Tom Brady (minimum 15 starts). What to know for fantasy: Two of L.A. receiver Mike Williams' top four career fantasy games have come in Kansas City -- including 22.8 points in Week 17 of last season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The over has cashed in each of the past three games these two teams have played at Arrowhead Stadium, with the Chargers covering the number twice. Read more.",61.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Patriots' run defense has been shaky -- the Jets totaled 152 yards on 31 carries with a 4.9-yard average -- and the Saints want to get running back Alvin Kamara going after eight carries for 5 yards vs. the Panthers in Week 2. So this is the matchup within the matchup. ""If you were trying to build a perfect back, he essentially gives you everything you need,"" Patriots linebacker Dont'a Hightower said of Kamara. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: Saints QB Jameis Winston will be held under 230 passing yards for the third straight week. It won't be as ugly as last week at Carolina, when the Saints' entire offense was held to just 128 yards and six first downs because of protection issues. But it will be hard to have a ""get right"" game against the Patriots' stingy defense, which ranks top five in the NFL through two weeks in points allowed (11.5 per game) and yards allowed (297.5 per game). -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: The Saints' 128 yards in Week 2 were the fewest in a game under coach Sean Payton since 2006. They have never had fewer than 250 yards in multiple games in a season under Payton. What to know for fantasy: Through two weeks, 74 players have more total yards than Kamara, and 136 have more targets than receiver Marquez Callaway. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Unders are 6-3 in the nine instances New England has been favored since Tom Brady took his talents to Tampa Bay. Read more.",40.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Washington defense came into the season with high expectations but has started the year ranked No. 25 in yards allowed and No. 17 in points allowed. Against a Bills offensive line that is still improving, the defensive front should have an opportunity to take a step forward. With Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen still getting into a rhythm, making his day difficult -- as the Steelers did in Week 1 -- would go a long way toward a potential upset. If the Bills' offense has its way, however, Washington could be in for a long day. -- Alaina Getzenberg Bold prediction: Bills receiver Stefon Diggs will surpass 100 yards for the first time this season, as Allen proves accurate enough to hit a big play or two. Diggs had seven 100-yard games last season but has gained just 69 and 60 yards, respectively, in the first two games of this season. In three games vs. Washington, he has surpassed 143 yards twice, albeit against a different group than he'll face Sunday. But Washington has allowed some big plays and benefitted from near misses. -- John Keim Stat to know: Washington has lost five straight road games at the Bills, and all by double digits. Its last road win at the Bills was in Week 8 of the 1987 season. What to know for fantasy: Allen has been held under 18 fantasy points in both games this season, a total he eclipsed in each of his final five games of last season. On Sunday, he takes on the fifth-best defense in terms of defending fantasy quarterbacks since the beginning of last season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Washington has won three of its past five as an underdog outright, and it went 4-1 against the spread (ATS) in those games. Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How will Bears rookie QB Justin Fields perform in his first career start? Chicago's future at quarterback has arrived, as the former Ohio State star returns to the Buckeye State. He is the Bears' 36th different starting quarterback since 1989 -- the second most in the NFL over that span behind the Browns (37). -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: Fields will rush for two touchdowns. He is still a work-in-progress in the passing game, but there is no denying his ability to run with the football. Don't be surprised if Fields also finishes with close to 100 rushing yards in his NFL regular-season starting debut. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Browns QB Baker Mayfield has a 81.6% completion percentage this season, the highest in NFL. The best completion percentage by a Browns quarterback through the team's first three games is 75.8% by Milt Plum in 1960 (minimum 20 pass attempts). What to know for fantasy: Chicago running back David Montgomery has posted more than 18.5 fantasy points in a road game five times during his career, and four have come in his past four opportunities. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: They rarely play the AFC North, but after covering last week against the Bengals, the Bears are 7-0-2 ATS against the division over the past decade. And they have covered each of their past three games against Cleveland. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Lions fix their mistakes and put together a complete game? Against San Francisco in Week 1, they started poor before ending strong. Then against Green Bay in Week 2, they got off to a hot start and folded late. This weekend, they're up against one of the league's most dynamic stars in Ravens QB Lamar Jackson. The Lions are looking to avoid an 0-3 start for first time since 2015, while this Baltimore team enters Ford Field with 41 straight games with 100 rushing yards -- the second-longest streak in NFL history. -- Eric Woodyard Bold prediction: The Ravens' defense will not allow a touchdown after giving up the second-most points in the NFL over the first two weeks. After not blitzing against Kansas City, Baltimore will get back to its aggressive style of defense in Detroit. In their only meeting against Lions QB Jared Goff, the Ravens intercepted him twice and forced him to throw off-target on 22.2% of his passes (Goff was then with the Rams). -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: Jackson has four straight games with 80 rushing yards -- the longest streak of his career. What to know for fantasy: Lions tight end T.J. Hockenson had never had a game with at least eight catches and a touchdown in his NFL career entering this season. However, he is the only player in the NFL who has produced that stat line in both Weeks 1 and 2 this year. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Goff is 0-3 ATS in his career as a double-digit road underdog, and Baltimore has covered each of its past three games against Detroit. Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Steelers edge rusher T.J. Watt and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger are banged up entering Sunday's AFC North matchup. Roethlisberger, who is 24-8 against the Bengals, might be able to play through the pain of the left pec injury, but if the Steelers' embattled offensive line can't withstand a pass rush led by Bengals defensive end Trey Hendrickson, it could be another long day for the QB. Defensively, the Steelers have a rash of injuries that could make it difficult to defend the deep ball from Bengals signal-caller Joe Burrow -- something Pittsburgh didn't do well in the loss against the Raiders. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Steelers running back Najee Harris will get 150 scrimmage yards. The Steelers have had fewer than 100 rushing yards in eight straight games, the longest active streak in NFL. But they should be able to get favorable matchups for Harris in the middle of the field against Cincinnati. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Pittsburgh receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster has gone 23 straight games without reaching 100 receiving yards, the longest streak of his career. On the other sideline, Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase has the chance to become the second player in NFL history with a touchdown catch of at least 40 yards in each of his first three career games (Billy Howton in 1952). What to know for fantasy: Cincinnati running back Joe Mixon has touched the ball 51 times in his past three games against the Steelers and hasn't scored once. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The Steelers have covered six of their past eight home games against the Bengals. Read more.",34.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Titans' banged-up offensive line is facing a Colts run defense that is allowing an uncharacteristic 120 yards per game on the ground. Over the past three seasons, the Colts' run defense allowed 100 or more rushing yards only three times. Regardless of who is blocking, expect the Titans to give running back Derrick Henry the ball early and often. Henry picked up 100 or more yards in each of his past three games facing the Colts. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: Titans receivers A.J. Brown and Julio Jones will each have 100 yards, and Henry will have at least 100 yards on the ground. The Colts' defense, as linebacker Darius Leonard said, has struggled putting together four quarters of consistent play for a season and a half. Leonard and Co. will struggle stopping the run and defending the pass with Brown and Jones lined up on the outside and Henry taking the handoffs. In the opening weeks, the Seahawks' Tyler Lockett and the Rams' Cooper Kupp each had 100 yards receiving against the Colts. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: Tennessee's Jones has 59 career games with 100 receiving yards, tied with Marvin Harrison for the third most in NFL history (behind Jerry Rice with 76 and Randy Moss with 64). What to know for fantasy: The Colts saw a receiver score over 17 fantasy points in both meetings with the Titans last season. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The Colts are 8-1 outright (7-2 ATS) in their past nine trips to Tennessee. Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: This is not a good matchup for the Jaguars. They've given up 619 yards and four passing touchdowns, and they haven't created a turnover in their two losses. The quarterbacks they have faced? Tyrod Taylor and Teddy Bridgewater. Solid players but not upper echelon QBs. Now comes Arizona's Kyler Murray, who has thrown for 689 yards and seven touchdowns (with three interceptions) in victories over Tennessee and Minnesota. -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: Murray will throw for 450 yards and three touchdowns while running for another 100 yards and a touchdown. He is seeking to become the first Cardinals player with back-to-back 400-yard passing games and can tie Carson Palmer (three) for the most 400-yard passing games in franchise history. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: The Jaguars have lost 17 straight games. With a loss, they would tie the 1972-73 Houston Oilers for the fifth-longest losing streak in NFL history. What to know for fantasy: Receiver Marvin Jones Jr. is the only Jaguar with a red zone or end zone target through two weeks. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Arizona has covered each of its past three games against Jacksonville, and the Jags have failed to cover each of their past three games as a home underdog. Read more.",55.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: It's a battle of 0-2 teams, and it's getting late early for these two teams. Who at least wants to pretend they are going to be a playoff contender this season? Neither team can afford to lose this one. Atlanta is seeking to avoid eight straight losses for the first time since 1996, while New York is attempting to prevent consecutive 0-3 starts for the second time in franchise history (1995-96). It's one of those games. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Giants running back Saquon Barkley will return to form with 150 yards rushing and a couple of touchdowns. The Falcons have the sixth-worst run defense in the league (4.9 yards per carry) and have yet to face a top-flight running back. For a while, Barkley was considered that. Coming off an injury last season and having 10 days of rest, this might be the healthiest Barkley has been in a while. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Receiver Sterling Shepard has at least seven receptions for 70 yards in four straight games, the second longest such streak by a Giants player since 1950 (Odell Beckham Jr. had six straight in 2014). What to know for fantasy: Atlanta running back Cordarrelle Patterson had nine touches to Mike Davis' 18 in Week 1, but Patterson greatly narrowed the gap in Week 2 (12 to 16). See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Over tickets have cashed in five of Atlanta's past seven games played in September -- and hit last week before the fourth quarter even kicked off. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Raiders' suddenly fierce pass rush faces a leaky Dolphins offensive line and backup QB Jacoby Brissett. Brissett is not only 11-19 and among the worst in QBR (47.3) and yards per attempt (6.5) over the past five seasons, but he is also the only QB in the league with at least 25 starts to complete less than 60% of his passes. Plus, he has been pressured on 34% of his dropbacks since 2017. Enter Raiders edge rushers Maxx Crosby and Yannick Ngakoue, who had 11 combined pressures last week at Pittsburgh and each forced a fumble. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: Raiders QB Derek Carr will have fewer than 300 passing yards. He leads the league in passing yards through two games (817), but Miami's defense has the talent to match up with Las Vegas' playmakers and will limit Carr on Sunday. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: Las Vegas leads the NFL with a 38.4% run stop win rate this season, while Miami's run block win rate ranks sixth. What to know for fantasy: Carr is QB8 through two weeks and leads the NFL in passing by 128 yards. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The under has hit just once in Vegas since the Raiders relocated (Week 10 last season vs. Denver). Read more.",38.5,LOW
" What to watch for: How will Jets rookie quarterback Zach Wilson navigate Vic Fangio's defensive scheme? With upgrades to the Broncos' secondary, head coach Fangio has deployed a bigger variety of coverages than the team did in the previous two seasons. Outside linebacker Von Miller has also come out of the gate strong with three sacks and five tackles for loss. Wilson, meanwhile, is tied for the league lead in interceptions with five and has been sacked more than any other quarterback (10). -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Broncos QB Teddy Bridgewater will continue his hot start and throw for 300 yards and two touchdowns. The Jets' defense has played surprisingly well in some areas, but it is still giving up too many explosive plays, having allowed 10 completions of 15 yards or more. Bridgewater will dissect their young pass defense. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: Broncos receiver Courtland Sutton is averaging 20.1 air yards per target (second in the NFL). He averaged 12.6 over his career entering 2021 season. What to know for fantasy: Three quarterbacks have completed 70% of their passes and scored 20 fantasy points in both weeks this season: Patrick Mahomes, Russell Wilson and Bridgewater. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: New York has covered just one game in September since 2019 (1-7 ATS over that span). And overall since the start of last season, it is 6-12 ATS, the worst cover percentage in the NFL. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" Bold prediction: Buccaneers defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh will close out the game by forcing a Stafford turnover and returning it for a touchdown. The last time the Bucs played the Rams in L.A. in 2019, Suh closed it out with a 37-yard fumble return for a touchdown. He'll relish the chance to do it again in L.A. and against his former Lions QB. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Rams receiver Cooper Kupp can become the fourth player in the Super Bowl era with 100 receiving yards and a TD reception in each of the first three games in a season (Randy Moss in 2007, Marvin Harrison in 1999, Jerry Rice in 1989 and Dwight Clark in 1982). What to know for fantasy: Tampa Bay receiver Mike Evans has scored over 29.5 points 12 times in his NFL career, and nine of them have come on the road. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: Tampa Bay has covered eight of its past 11 games, dating back to last season (including the playoffs). But Los Angeles has covered seven of its past eight meetings with the Bucs. Read more.",56.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Seahawks and Vikings might as well be in the same division, considering this is the fourth meeting between the two teams in the regular season since 2018. Seattle QB Russell Wilson has a 7-0 record against Minnesota, tied for second best by any active QB against any one opponent. The winless Vikings are at a critical juncture as they begin a stretch that could decide the direction of the season. Fortunately for Minnesota, these next two are at home, the first time in 636 days that fans will pack into U.S. Bank Stadium. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Either Adam Thielen or Justin Jefferson will top 100 yards receiving for the Vikings. It's another bad matchup for the Seahawks' defense. Seattle cornerback Tre Flowers had his issues in coverage last week, getting beat deep by both Julio Jones and A.J. Brown. If he fails to stay on top again Sunday, here's a bonus prediction: You'll see Sidney Jones IV come off the bench to replace him. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Minnesota QB Kirk Cousins has four straight games with multiple pass touchdowns and no interceptions. That's the longest streak in franchise history and the longest active streak in NFL. But the Vikings are just 1-3 in those games. What to know for fantasy: Since the beginning of last season, Seattle receiver Tyler Lockett averages 34% more fantasy points per game than DK Metcalf in road games and is responsible for three of this duo's four 25-plus point efforts over that sample. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The Seahawks covered easily in Week 1 at Indianapolis, a positive sign after covering just twice away from home last season (their first time failing to cover three road games in a season since 2010). Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the 49ers' pass rush do enough to help their cornerbacks in a difficult matchup? The Niners are thin at corner after losing Jason Verrett for the season, and the Packers bring the stiffest test yet with QB Aaron Rodgers, WR Davante Adams and Co. coming to town. The best coverage for San Francisco might actually be a dominant pass rush, which seems possible given the Niners are fifth in the league in pass rush wins and Green Bay has allowed five sacks through the first two games and is still without star left tackle David Bakhtiari. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: Brandon Aiyuk will finally have a big day. Don't be surprised to see him catch at least five passes for 70 yards and a score. It's almost unfathomable that the 49ers' dynamic second-year receiver has only one catch for six yards so far this season. But the Packers can't get a pass rush (one sack through two games) and have been prone to breakdowns in coverage. That's a good combination for opposing receivers. Green Bay is still moving players around in the secondary, and with receiver Deebo Samuel to worry about, Aiyuk is bound to find holes in their secondary. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: Samuel has 282 receiving yards this season, the most by a 49ers player through two games in a season since Jerry Rice in 1989 (285). What to know for fantasy: Rodgers has scored over 22 fantasy points in five of his seven career games against the Niners. See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The Packers have covered four of their past five games in the week after a Monday night game, but unders are 3-2 in those games. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can the Cowboys continue to make the explosive play on offense? Through two games, the Cowboys have 35 plays of 10 or more yards, the third most in the NFL. But the Eagles' defense has not allowed many big plays in its first two games, with just 19 against going for 10 yards or more, which is the third fewest. It's also worth noting that Cowboys QB Dak Prescott has seven interceptions in eight games against the Eagles, his most against any opponent. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Dallas running back Tony Pollard will have more than 150 total yards. That's well within the realm of possibility after he rushed for 109 yards and a touchdown with 31 receiving yards last week against the Chargers. The Eagles' zone-based scheme forces the opponent to methodically work its way down the field. There are yards to be had in the run game and underneath in the pass game, and Pollard will take advantage. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Eagles QB Jalen Hurts has 416 rushing yards in six career starts, the third most by a QB through six career starts since 1950 (Lamar Jackson had 466, and Tim Tebow had 439). What to know for fantasy: Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott had just two more touches than Pollard last week (18 to 16). See Week 3 rankings. Betting nugget: The home team has covered each of the past five matchups in this series. The last road cover came by the Cowboys in Week 10 of 2018. Read more.",54.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Tom Brady's homecoming isn't the only one in Week 4. Reigning Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski returns to Minnesota where he spent the first 13 seasons of his career for a matchup with his former boss, Mike Zimmer. The Vikings have a 1-2 record after losing their first two games by a combined four points, while the Browns barely missed out on a 3-0 start. Both teams boast top-seven offenses, and while the Vikings are more explosive on that end, Cleveland's pass rush and defensive depth might hold the edge. -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Browns QB Baker Mayfield and Vikings QB Kirk Cousins will combine for five play-action touchdown passes. On such plays, Cousins leads the NFL in QBR (94.1) and is tied for third in TD passes with three. Those five play-action touchdowns will prove to be the only scores of the game. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: Cleveland is tied atop the NFL in pass rush win rate (with Carolina) at 58.4%. And star edge rusher Myles Garrett is coming off a 4.5-sack performance in Week 3. That's the most by a Browns player in a game since sacks become official in 1982. What to know for fantasy: Vikings receiver Adam Thielen has scored in all three games this season, and he's just getting started. Did you know that he has caught a TD pass in 11 straight October games? See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: The Browns covered on Sunday against the Bears, just their second cover over the past decade in nine games against the NFC North. Read more.",39.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Can the Cowboys' offense control the tempo of the game against the NFL's top defense through three weeks? After throwing it 58 times for 403 yards in the opener against Tampa Bay, the Cowboys have run for 198 and 160 yards. They have displayed a versatility on offense that makes it difficult for defenses to take away one phase. The Panthers are allowing just 10 points per game, but they have faced the Jets and Texans playing rookie quarterbacks, along with a Saints offense that is still adjusting to new starting quarterback Jameis Winston. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Panthers quarterback Sam Darnold will outperform Dallas' Dak Prescott -- mainly because he'll be under less duress. The Panthers lead the NFL in sacks (14) and quarterback hits (27), a big reason they rank No. 1 in average passing yards allowed (146.0) and third-down efficiency against (21.2%). They are facing a Dallas team that gave up four sacks to the Eagles on Monday night. Dallas' defense ranks 29th in the league in sacks (four) and 31st in average passing yards allowed (331.7). -- David Newton Stat to know: Darnold has won three straight games as a starter -- and five of his past six. But he has never won four straight games as a starter in his career. Darnold also now has 300 passing yards in back-to-back games, and no Panthers QB has ever thrown for at least that many in three straight games. What to know for fantasy: In Prescott's past three starts on a short week (Dallas played on Monday), he has averaged 347 passing yards and thrown for multiple scores in all three games. And in those three games, he averaged 25.3 fantasy points. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Carolina is 8-1 against the spread (ATS) on the road under coach Matt Rhule (since 2020). That's the best road cover percentage in the NFL over that span. Read more.",46.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Eagles running backs received three total carries in their Monday night loss to the Cowboys. Only 9.4% of their plays were designed runs, the fourth-lowest rate in an NFL game over the past 15 seasons. It proved to be a serious miscalculation. Expect coach Nick Sirianni to remedy that this week, especially against a Chiefs defense that ranks 31st in rushing yards allowed (160.3 per game). -- Tim McManus Bold prediction: The Chiefs won't commit a turnover, and quarterback Patrick Mahomes will at long last start a game that is decided by more than one score. The Chiefs have turned the ball over six times in the past two games, but they will protect it better against the Eagles, who are tied for the bottom of the league with just one takeaway in three games. The past 10 Chiefs' regular-season games started by Mahomes were decided by six points or fewer, but that streak will end. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Despite blitzing at the fifth-highest rate in the NFL, the Chiefs rank 27th in pressure rate this season, down from second in 2020. What to know for fantasy: Kansas City running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire recorded more rushing yards last week (100) than he had in the first two games combined (89), but the former LSU star still doesn't have a touch gaining at least 15 yards this season. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: The Eagles are 4-1 outright in their past five when playing at home on a short week (they played on Monday night in Dallas), a run that comes on the tails of losing eight of nine such games. Read more.",55.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can rookie quarterback Davis Mills take a step forward against the Bills' defense? Buffalo has forced three turnovers in each of the past two games, but the pass rush has struggled to find consistency. While it should be a difficult outing for Houston's offense, there might be opportunities to put points on the board if the Texans can somehow take advantage of the Bills up front. Otherwise, it will be a long day for the rookie in Buffalo. -- Alaina Getzenberg Bold prediction: Houston receiver Brandin Cooks will again hit 100 receiving yards. Yes, the Bills have allowed just 178.0 passing yards per game (fourth in the NFL), but Cooks has shown through three weeks that the Texans' offense runs through him. He has 322 receiving yards so far, the most in Texans history through three games. And in the six quarters the pair has played together, 20 of Mills' 42 pass attempts and 13 of his 27 completions have gone to Cooks. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: Buffalo's Josh Allen has 14 straight games with a passing touchdown (including playoffs). It's the third-longest streak in franchise history. What to know for fantasy: Allen scored 37.2 points in Week 3 against Washington after totaling just 33.9 points in the first two weeks combined. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: The Bills have failed to cover each of their past four home games in October (5-2 ATS at home in November over the past three seasons). Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Will New Orleans' return to the Superdome provide an overwhelming home-field advantage, after the Saints were displaced for 29 days because of Hurricane Ida to start this season? It should be especially beneficial for a Saints defense that ranks No. 1 in the NFL in points allowed and No. 2 in yards allowed since Week 4 of last season. -- Mike Triplett Bold prediction: Saints running back Alvin Kamara will have 100 yards receiving. Sure he has only 62 such yards in three games, but the versatile back gets to face a Giants defense that will be trying to replace middle linebacker Blake Martinez. New York defensive coordinator Patrick Graham admitted it will be a ""collective"" effort trying to fill that void. That's not ideal when facing a player as dangerous as Kamara. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: New Orleans quarterback Jameis Winston has been pressured on 42% of his dropbacks this season, the fourth-highest mark among qualified quarterbacks. But the Giants rank 28th in pass rush win rate. What to know for fantasy: Giants running back Saquon Barkley logged 22 touches last week, the exact number he averaged during his standout rookie season. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: The Giants have covered 12 of 17 road games since the beginning of 2019, but they are an underwhelming 4-8 outright in those contests. Read more.",49.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Dolphins quarterback Jacoby Brissett faces his former team for the first time Sunday, and it's not the best matchup for him. The Colts play zone coverage at the seventh-highest rate in the NFL, while Brissett ranks 32nd in yards per attempt and 29th in completion percentage against zone looks. Expect Indianapolis to shy away from man coverage, against which Brissett is far more successful (10th in completion percentage). -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: The Colts will sack Brissett at least four times, which equates to half of the eight sacks Indy has on the season. Brissett has been sacked six times in the past two games, and the Dolphins have given up 10 sacks in just three games this season. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: Miami receiver Jaylen Waddle has 22 receptions, the second most by a player through three career games in the Super Bowl era. The most receptions through four career games is 30 by Anquan Boldin. What to know for fantasy: Colts running back Jonathan Taylor scored under 8.5 fantasy points in just two games during his strong rookie campaign, but he has done that in each of the past two weeks. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: The under is 26-17 in Carson Wentz starts since 2018 (including the playoffs). Read more.",28.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Atlanta QB Matt Ryan has career lows in yards per dropback (5.3) and yards per attempt (6.0), but Washington's defense is allowing 7.2 yards per dropback. The Falcons' offense has not been able to find intermediate and deep routes this year, but could this be the week that Ryan rediscovers going deep? -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Washington edge rusher Chase Young -- sackless in his first three games -- will record two sacks and a forced fumble for his first impact game of the season. Young is still evolving as a pass-rusher, and coach Ron Rivera said he needs to be more consistent with how he's rushing -- way less stutter-stepping and more explosion off the line. Young will face a struggling right tackle in Kaleb McGary and an immobile quarterback in Ryan. This defense needs a big game from Young. -- John Keim Stat to know: Washington has a 26.5% conversion rate on third down this season (worst in the NFL). The last time an NFL team was below 30% for the full season was Washington in 2019 (29.1%). What to know for fantasy: Seven of Falcons receiver Calvin Ridley's top 10 career fantasy games have come at Mercedes Benz Stadium. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Unders have hit in eight of the 10 games the Falcons have played against the NFC East over the past five seasons. Read more.",16154772.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This says everything about the matchup: Titans RB Derrick Henry has three touchdowns, one more than the total for the entire Jets offense. With rookie QB Zach Wilson struggling to stay upright (15 sacks), the Jets are staring at their third straight 0-4 start. The Titans, who won't have receiver A.J. Brown (hamstring) and, possibly, Julio Jones (leg), will lean on Henry as they bid for their third straight win. -- Rich Cimini Bold prediction: The Titans' defense will generate three turnovers. You know it's bad when right tackle David Quessenberry leads the team in forced fumbles, but the focus all week for Tennessee has been to find ways to get turnovers, whether it be stripping the football or getting hands on it in the air. Tennessee is last in the NFL with 0.3 turnovers per game. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Jets have scored 20 points through their first three games, tied for the fewest through three games in franchise history (1976). Their fewest scored through the first four games in a season? Twenty-four in 1971. What to know for fantasy: The Titans are road favorites for the 10th time since the beginning of 2019. In the nine previous instances, Henry averaged 146.6 rushing yards and has five games with multiple rushing scores. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Unders are 11-6 since the beginning of 2019 when the Jets play at home. But Tennessee has gone 13-5-1 to the over since the start of last season. Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bears are desperate for a victory, but the Lions are a scrappy bunch. Detroit kept it close against the Ravens and for a while against the Packers, whereas the Bears have been blown out in two of their three games. Chicago is under immense pressure to rebound after last week's debacle in Cleveland, where the Bears finished with just 47 net yards and 1 net passing yard. To say the Soldier Field crowd will be on edge is an understatement. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: The Lions will get their first victory of the Dan Campbell era. Although last week's loss to Baltimore was stunning, there were also some positives to take away -- notably on the defensive side -- to give them confidence moving forward. Lions tight end T.J. Hockenson said they have ""to take a win,"" and a matchup with the Bears is a good opportunity to avoid their first 0-4 start since 2015. -- Eric Woodyard Stat to know: Chicago receiver Allen Robinson II has four straight games under 40 receiving yards (dating back to last season). It's his longest streak since a career-long streak in 2016 (five games). What to know for fantasy: Lions running back D'Andre Swift joins Christian McCaffrey as the only two RBs this season with multiple top-five finishes at the position. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: The over has cashed in each of the past three times these NFC North rivals have matched up. Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Rams and Cardinals are among five NFL teams that enter Week 4 undefeated. The Rams are a perfect 8-0 against the Cardinals since Sean McVay took over as coach in 2017, but Sunday's matchup could go either way. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has been named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week twice this season, and the one week he did not earn the honor, it went to Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, who has taken another step forward in his third season playing for coach Kliff Kingsbury. The Cardinals are tied for first in the league in scoring, averaging 34.3 points per game, while the Rams rank No. 3 (31.7). -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Murray will have 400-plus passing yards and 100-plus rushing yards while being responsible for five touchdowns. He is playing at an MVP level, and that won't slow down against one of the best defensive players of this generation in Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald. We'll see more theatrics and heroics from Murray, who'll have to run for his life at times, but the Cardinals have found success in turning broken plays into yards and points. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: The Rams are 40-0, including playoffs, under McVay when leading at halftime -- the second-longest streak in NFL history. What to know for fantasy: Since the beginning of last season, the top five QB games against the Cardinals have been aided by the signal-caller running for more than 30 yards. Stafford's last game with over 30 rushing yards came in Week 7 of 2016. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Unders are 8-2 in Rams home games since the beginning of last season. In those eight games, the Rams are 6-2 outright (5-3 ATS). Read more.",68.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: San Francisco knew the Packers would throw early and often to Davante Adams last week, and that didn't prevent him from going for 12 catches, 132 yards and a touchdown. So with a depleted cornerback group, how will the 49ers cover Seattle receivers DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett? Metcalf had 12 catches, 161 yards and two touchdowns in these teams' first meeting last year, while Lockett posted 12 catches, 90 yards and two scores in the second. It's too early to call any game a must-win, but this one is huge for both teams. Barring a tie in the Rams-Cardinals game, a Seattle loss would put it three games back in the difficult NFC West, while a 49ers defeat would drop them two games back. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: The Seahawks and 49ers will combine for at least 750 yards of offense. Each defense is dealing with issues at cornerback, and the Seahawks' problems go well beyond that. It has struggled against screens (which are a big part of San Francisco's offense), allowed 112 rushing yards last week to Minnesota's backup running back, Alexander Mattison, and have gotten gashed through the air in consecutive games. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: Wilson is 15-4 against the 49ers, including playoffs. Those 15 wins are the second most by a starting QB against San Francisco in NFL history -- behind Johnny Unitas (17). What to know for fantasy: Lockett had 33 fantasy points in the Week 17 matchup with San Francisco last season, but in the six meetings with the Niners prior, he averaged a mere 8.6 points per game. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: Overs are 5-0-1 over the past three seasons when these two teams square off. Read more.",63.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: A lot has been made of the Broncos' defense trying to keep Ravens QB Lamar Jackson from dispensing highlights, but the game might really hinge on what Broncos quarterback Teddy Bridgewater does against a Ravens defense that hasn't slowed opposing quarterbacks all that much. Bridgewater is second in the NFL in completion percentage (76.8%) and eighth in yards per attempt (8.7). The Ravens have allowed 995 yards passing in three games, as well as five passing touchdowns. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: A week after setting the NFL record for the longest field goal, Justin Tucker will establish a new mark in the thin air of Denver, winning the game with a 67-yard field goal. Tucker is 5-for-5 in three games in the Mile High City, including a 52-yard field goal. There have been three field goals of 63 yards or longer made in Denver since 1998. Asked about Tucker's range in Denver, coach John Harbaugh said, ""I don't know. It's a good question."" -- Jamison Hensley Stat to know: Jackson threw for at least 200 yards and rushed for at least 50 yards in each of the first three games, becoming the first player to do that in NFL history. The only player to do it in four straight games at any point of a season was Michael Vick in 2011, per Elias Sports Bureau research. What to know for fantasy: Broncos receiver Tim Patrick has scored over 12.5 fantasy points in all three weeks this season and continues to see his role grow as the injuries in the WR room pile up. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: The Ravens are 6-3 ATS in their past nine games that had a spread under three points (in either direction). Read more.",48.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Packers QB Aaron Rodgers and Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger have played against each other only twice before, including Super Bowl XLV, and this could be one of those classic quarterback duels won by whomever has the ball last. Look for both to hit milestones, as well. Big Ben needs just one more touchdown pass to become the eighth quarterback in NFL history with 400 of them. Rodgers, with 418, needs just two more to tie Dan Marino for sixth on the all-time list and three more to tie Philip Rivers for fifth. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: The Steelers won't blitz Rodgers. Seriously. That was the Saints' plan in their Week 1 route of the Packers, and the Steelers used a similar blueprint in their Week 1 upset win against the Bills, blitzing just twice on 54 pass attempts. The Steelers showed they can get plenty of pressure with a four-man rush and let their secondary go to work. Replicating the plan used against the Bills won't be quite as easy without nose tackle Tyson Alualu, but it's the best hope for the Steelers to limit the damage done by Rodgers. -- Brooke Pryor Stat to know: The Steelers have nine drops through three games, which is their most since ESPN started tracking the stat in 2006. What to know for fantasy: In Week 3, Steelers running back Najee Harris became the fourth player in NFL history with a 14-catch/14-carry game. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: The under has come through in seven of the past 10 Steelers games. Read more.",50.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady is 68 yards from surpassing Drew Brees as the NFL's all-time leading passer (currently at 80,291), and he should become No. 1 early in Sunday's game. That he will do so in Gillette Stadium, his old home stadium, adds another layer to what has the makings of a memorable night. The Patriots are expected to honor Brady in some form before the game, likely with a video tribute. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: The Buccaneers will match their season sack total with three of the Patriots' Mac Jones. ""I love playing rookie quarterbacks,"" outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett said. He added, ""I wanna win every week, but I have an extra chip on my shoulder this week,"" referring to Brady's homecoming trip back to Foxborough. -- Jenna Laine Stat to know: Brady looks to join Peyton Manning, Brett Favre and Brees as the only starting QBs to defeat all 32 current franchises. Additionally, Brady has won against 30 teams as a visitor and would pass Brees and Manning for the most teams beaten on the road in NFL history with a win. (He has not beaten the Patriots or Seahawks on the road.) What to know for fantasy: While Mike Evans, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski offer spike weeks, Tampa Bay's Chris Godwin is always there. The former Nittany Lion has scored over 16 points in all three weeks this season and in five straight dating back to last season. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: This is just the 19th time that New England has been a home underdog since 2000, the fewest such instances of any team in the NFL. New England is 14-4 ATS in the previous 18 such instances. Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Raiders QB Derek Carr is playing at a high level, helping the Raiders put up the fifth-most points in the NFL thus far and leading the league in passing (1,203 yards). But the Raiders' defense might be even more key in this one against Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who had a bounce-back game last weekend against the Chiefs. One matchup to watch will be Las Vegas edge rushers Maxx Crosby and Yannick Ngakoue against Chargers rookie left tackle Rashawn Slater. -- Shelley Smith Bold prediction: Carr's streak of passing for at least 325 yards in five straight games, dating to Week 16 of last season, will come to a halt. The Chargers boast the best defense Las Vegas has faced yet, and the Raiders want to be more balanced with the run game. If they become too one-dimensional with the passing game, that allows the likes of Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa to simply pin his ears back and attack. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Chargers receiver Mike Williams has at least one receiving TD in his first three games this season (four total). He is now seeking to join Antonio Gates (2010) and Tony Martin (1996) as the only players in Chargers history to catch a touchdown in each of the team's first four games of the season. He also needs 105 receiving yards to join Lance Alworth (1965) and Gary Garrison (1968) as the only Chargers with 400-plus receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns through the team's first four games. What to know for fantasy: A quarterback attempted at least five deep passes and completed 65% of those passes twice against the Raiders last season: Justin Herbert in Week 9, and Herbert in Week 15. See Week 4 rankings. Betting nugget: The Raiders are 9-3-2 ATS in their past 14 prime-time games (7-7 outright). Read more.",49.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: According to the Elias Sports Bureau, this is the first time ever that two interception-less teams have met this late in the season. Atlanta dropped multiple near-interceptions last week, and Falcons defensive coordinator Dean Pees said he needs his defensive backs to be attacking the ball more. Jets quarterback Zach Wilson leads the NFL with eight interceptions, while Atlanta's Matt Ryan has three, so perhaps this is the week that at least one of these teams gets a big takeaway through the air. -- Michael Rothstein Bold prediction: Rookie running back Michael Carter will deliver the Jets' first 100-yard rushing day of the season. The Jets will approach this game with a ball-control mindset, hoping to give the defense a break. The defense was on the field for 93 plays last week, the fourth-highest amount in an NFL game since 2000. The unit was gassed, and a cross-Atlantic trip to London didn't help. Enter Carter, who will have a breakout game. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: Ryan's average pass has traveled 5.9 air yards, the lowest in NFL this season. He is 2-of-8 on passes of at least 20 yards downfield and will be without No. 1 receiver Calvin Ridley on Sunday. What to know for fantasy: Falcons running back Cordarrelle Patterson has been a top-20 back in each of the past three weeks, including a pair of top-five finishes at the position. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Favorites in London games are 17-11 against the spread (ATS). But Atlanta -- the favorite in this one -- is 1-5 outright and ATS as a favorite since the start of last season. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bucs' pass rush finally got things going last week in an emotional win over the Patriots. They can build off that against a Dolphins' offensive line that has surrendered 13 sacks so far this season -- fourth-most in the NFL -- and in turn protect a very vulnerable secondary that may be without all three starting cornerbacks and safety Antoine Winfield Jr. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: In presumably his final start before Tua Tagovailoa returns, Dolphins quarterback Jacoby Brissett will leave it all on the field. He will throw two interceptions as a result of more aggressive decision-making, but he also will find the end zone three times on Sunday. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Stat to know: With his tight end Rob Gronkowski (ribs) out, Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady went 2-of-8 for 29 yards with a 50% off-target percentage when throwing to tight ends against the Patriots. He has not thrown a touchdown to a tight end outside of Gronkowski since Week 10 of last season (Cameron Brate). What to know for fantasy: Dolphins tight end Mike Gesicki has 35.3 points in Brissett's two starts this season and 7.1 in Tagovailoa' s two starts. It's Brissett's job for at least one more week, and it figures to be a pass-heavy game script. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Since the start of last season, Miami is 6-1 ATS following a straight-up loss and 5-1 ATS as a road underdog. Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will Washington's defense attack the Saints' running back Alvin Kamara? Washington's linebackers have not played well and will be challenged by an offense that ranks seventh in the NFL with 132.8 rushing yards per game, led by Kamara with 209 yards combined over the past two weeks. Washington ranks 11th in yards per carry allowed and 17th in rushing yards per game, so it will need to force New Orleans quarterback Jameis Winston to beat it. -- John Keim Bold prediction: The Saints' defense will make a statement after last week's uncharacteristic collapse against the Giants. They'll limit Washington to less than 50 rushing yards and force at least two interceptions, just like they did in wins over Green Bay and New England in Weeks 1 and 3. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: Washington quarterback Taylor Heinicke has multiple passing touchdowns in each of his first three regular-season starts with Washington. The only QB in team history to throw multiple TDs in four straight games over past 15 seasons is Kirk Cousins (twice). What to know for fantasy: Washington receiver Terry McLaurin set a career-high with 27.7 points in Week 2 and then topped it on Sunday in Atlanta with 30.3. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: After seeing the under hit in six straight games, the over has now hit in back-to-back-to-back Washington games. Read more.",39.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Bengals are looking for their first three-game winning streak since 2018 and are facing the toughest test to date this season. Meanwhile, the Packers are dealing with several key injuries. Green Bay finished its Week 4 win over Pittsburgh without seven starters. -- Ben Baby Bold prediction: Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will throw a rare pick-six. It has happened only three times in his career, but one of them came in the last meeting with the Bengals. Weird things seem to happen when the Packers play in Cincy. There was the 2005 game when a fan ran onto the field and snatched the ball out of Brett Favre's hands to stall a potential game-winning drive, and then there was the Jonathan Franklin fumble that the Bengals returned for the game-winning touchdown in 2013. This one won't cost the Packers the game, but it will make it close. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: Green Bay receiver Davante Adams' 31 receptions lead the NFL and are his most through four games in his career. He also has 16 straight games with at least five catches, the longest active streak in the NFL and longest by a Packer since Sterling Sharpe (18 straight from 1993-94). What to know for fantasy: One active player had a 30-yard catch in each of his first four career games: Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase. Since 2013, Stefon Diggs (2015) is the only player to rattle off five straight games with such a catch at any point during his rookie season. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: The Bengals are 7-4 ATS in their past 11 games as a home underdog. Read more.",55.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: This game will be all about the battle up front, and edge rushers Von Miller (Broncos) and T.J. Watt (Steelers) against the offensive lines. The team that can generate the most pressure on the quarterback and force the most turnovers will come out ahead in this one. The Steelers' defense hasn't lived up to its Week 1 performance against the Bills, but this could be a get-right game against an undermanned Broncos' offense -- if they can slow down Denver running back Javonte Williams. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger may be trying to get rid of the ball as fast as possible -- he has three games this season with an average yards per attempt under 6 yards, and running back Najee Harris, at just under 7 yards per catch is the team's leading receiver -- but the Broncos will still sack him at least five times. And if they can consistently generate pressure in between the sacks, they should get their first road win in Pittsburgh since 2006. -- Jeff Legwold Stat to know: Denver receiver Courtland Sutton has an average target depth of 17.4 yards downfield this season, the second-highest distance in the NFL behind Henry Ruggs III (17.5). What to know for fantasy: Denver tight end Noah Fant has three weeks with over 12 fantasy points. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Pittsburgh and Denver are two of only four NFL teams to go under the total in every game this season. Read more.",36.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Carolina's offensive line is banged up with starting left tackle Cameron Erving (neck) not expected to play and left guard Pat Elflein still on IR with a hamstring injury. Trent Scott or rookie Brady Christensen could start for Erving, and coach Matt Rhule hasn't ruled out moving right tackle Taylor Moton to the left side. With running back Christian McCaffrey (hamstring) possibly returning, how the line performs against the NFL's 31st-ranked defense against the run is key. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Panthers QB Sam Darnold's carriage will turn back into a pumpkin. It's been quite the Cinderella start for Darnold, who has three games with 300-plus passing yards this season and multiple rushing touchdowns each of the past two games. But his offensive line has been shaky even before the injuries. Carolina ranks 30th with a pass block win rate of 44%, and Darnold has been sacked 11 times, tied for sixth-most. Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon and defensive tackle Fletcher Cox have faced sharp criticism after yielding over 850 yards the past two weeks, and each will come with an edge. Darnold will be roughed up and commit multiple turnovers. -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Panthers receiver DJ Moore has 398 receiving yards this season, which is third-most through the team's first four games of the season in Panthers history. What to know for fantasy: Darnold has gone over 25 points in consecutive games, while Philadelphia's Jalen Hurts has been a top-11 quarterback every week this season. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: The Eagles are just 6-12 (both outright and ATS) over their past 18 road games. Read more.",50.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Minnesota quarterback Kirk Cousins has dominated the Lions as a member of the Vikings, having thrown 15 touchdowns and one interception since 2018, and Minnesota is in the midst of a seven-game win streak over its divisional foe with an average margin of victory of 11.6 points per game. It won't get easier this week for the Lions. Detroit's offensive line will be shorthanded against Minnesota's stout pass rush (3.2 sacks per game, tied for third in the NFL). Center Frank Ragnow (toe) was placed on injured reserve this week, and the Lions are also preparing to play without left tackle Penei Sewell (ankle). -- Courtney Cronin Bold prediction: Lions rookie wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown will make at least five catches. He had a breakout performance against Chicago last week, catching a game-high six passes for 70 yards -- both career-highs. Look for quarterback Jared Goff to try to connect with the receivers more to open up the potential of the offense, and St. Brown should get targeted more after proving he could make plays on the road. -- Eric Woodyard Stat to know: Yes, Vikings running back Dalvin Cook had just 34 rushing yards in a Week 4 loss to the Browns, his fewest in a game since 2019. But he had a career-high 206 in his last meeting with the Lions (Week 9 last season) and has averaged 106.3 rushing yards per game -- and scored six TDs on the ground -- in six career games against Detroit. What to know for fantasy: Cousins has scored more than 20 fantasy points in four of his past five games against the Lions. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: The over hit in five of Minnesota's six divisional games last season, including both matchups with Detroit. Read more.",51.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will the Texans' run game show any improvement? The Patriots are ranked 28th in Football Outsiders' DVOA against the run, but can Houston take advantage? The team ranks 30th in rush DVOA so far and has gone downhill since Mark Ingram II ran for 85 yards and a touchdown in Week 1. -- Sarah Barshop Bold prediction: The Patriots will rush for 200 yards as a team, with running back Damien Harris leading the way by eclipsing the 100-yard mark and scoring 2 TDs. The Texans rank 28th in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game, and the Patriots are determined to get their ground game going after totaling minus-1 yard on 8 carries in last Sunday's loss to the Buccaneers. -- Mike Reiss Stat to know: Houston QB Davis Mills posted a 0.8 Total QBR against the Bills in a Week 4 shutout, the fourth lowest in the past five seasons. He'd join Case Keenum as the only Texans players to lose their first three career starts with a loss on Sunday. What to know for fantasy: Patriots receiver Jakobi Meyers has 42 targets this season -- tied for fifth most in the NFL -- and two straight games with 15-plus fantasy points. The last Patriots receiver with three straight 15-plus-point games was Julian Edelman from Week 12 to Week 14 in 2019. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: New England is 57-31 ATS following a straight-up loss under coach Bill Belichick. Read more.",32.0,LOW
" What to watch for: This game is all about getting Derrick Henry going -- and trying to stop him. In the first game these two teams play each year over the past three seasons, Henry has rushed for 185 yards and one touchdown. In the rematch, he has rushed for 612 yards and eight touchdowns. That doesn't mean Henry won't go off on Sunday, but the Jaguars do rank fifth defensively in the NFL in yards per carry allowed (3.7). -- Mike DiRocco Bold prediction: The Titans won't allow a sack against the Jaguars. That's saying a lot, despite Jacksonville only have five sacks this season -- the Titans have allowed a league-high 17. The blame has been placed on receivers not getting open, quarterback Ryan Tannehill holding on to the ball too long and offensive linemen getting beat up front. Two things can help solve those issues: the possible return of receiver A.J. Brown and offensive coordinator Todd Downing going to more bunch formations to create separation and allow Tannehill to get rid of the ball more quickly. -- Turron Davenport Stat to know: The Jaguars -- who are in the midst of a 19-game losing streak (tied for second-longest in NFL history) -- have allowed 20-plus points in 22 straight games, the NFL's fourth-longest all-time streak. What to know for fantasy: Henry has 11 rushing scores in 10 career games against Jacksonville, including four in Week 14 of 2018 on his way to a career-high 47.8 points. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Jacksonville has failed to cover in each of its last four games as a home underdog. Read more.",42.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Browns' pass rush has been nearly unstoppable over the past two weeks with 11.0 sacks combined. Myles Garrett leads the NFL with six sacks. But Garrett and the Browns face a tough Chargers front, led by center Corey Linsley and rookie tackle Rashawn Slater. Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert has been pressured on just 25.6% of his dropbacks this season, fifth-lowest in the NFL, so the question becomes whether this front can keep Garrett and Co. away from Herbert. -- Shelley Smith Bold prediction: The two defenses in this game will combine for eight sacks. The Chargers' Joey Bosa and the Browns' Garrett will lead the way with two apiece in a defensive struggle. The Browns rank No. 1 in the NFL in pass rush win rate, while the Chargers are No. 9. -- Jake Trotter Stat to know: Chargers running back Austin Ekeler is averaging 5.7 yards per rush this season, the third-most in the NFL (min. 40 rushes). He has at least 100 scrimmage yards in three straight games, which is tied with Derrick Henry for the longest active streak in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Cleveland running back Kareem Hunt is widely viewed as the RB2 in Cleveland, but over the past two weeks, he's averaging more fantasy points (22.1) than Nick Chubb (19.9). See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Cleveland is 3-11 ATS against AFC opponents since the start of last season. Read more.",38.0,LOW
" What to watch for: The Khalil Mack ""homecoming"" has arrived. Talk about awkward. Mack never played for Las Vegas coach Jon Gruden, forcing a trade with his 2018 holdout, and called Oakland home for four years, never playing in Vegas. The last time the Raiders faced Mack was in London in 2019, and they held him sack-less. Mack and Raiders QB Derek Carr are close friends, and they always argued over who is faster. But with his battered offensive line, Carr might not want to find out on Sunday. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: The Raiders will sack Bears quarterback Justin Fields five times. Fields -- Chicago's newly anointed permanent starting quarterback -- is incredibly mobile, but the Bears are without top running back David Montgomery and are therefore susceptible to being one-dimensional on offense on Sunday. The Browns sacked Fields nine times just two weeks ago. The Bears' offensive line is known to badly struggle against elite pass-rushers, and the Raiders have several of those. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Carr has averaged 12.4 yards per attempt on third down this season, the most in the NFL. What to know for fantasy: Bears receiver Allen Robinson II has averaged 1,199 receiving yards per season over the past two years, but he's on pace for just over half of that this season (633) -- and that includes an extra game. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Not only has the under cashed in each of Chicago's past three games, none of them have seen more than 38 points scored. But Las Vegas is 15-5 to the over since the start of last season, the highest over percentage in the NFL. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: This much we know about Sunday: The Cardinals will face either Jimmy Garoppolo or Trey Lance -- or both. Each presents their own unique game plan. Garoppolo is a pocket passer, while Lance is more of a dual-threat option, the likes of which the Cardinals' first-team defense sees every day in practice against their own Kyler Murray. If he starts, Lance would be the fourth-youngest quarterback to start his first game in the Super Bowl era, at 21 years and 154 days old. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Cardinals receiver DeAndre Hopkins will finish with 14-plus catches. The 49ers are still thin at cornerback, even as they hope to welcome back veteran Josh Norman, and Hopkins had 22 receptions in two games against San Francisco last season. Now the Niners have to account for the likes of A.J. Green and Rondale Moore, as well. This game could be tighter than many expect, but Hopkins could be the difference-maker. -- Nick Wagoner Stat to know: The Cardinals can become the sixth team in NFL history with 30 points in each of the first five games of the season. A lot of that has to do with quarterback Kyler Murray's hot start. Only 5.5% of his passes from the pocket have been off-target incompletions. That's just 6 balls on 113 total attempts. And he is threading the needle downfield. According to ESPN route analysis powered by NFL Next Gen Stats, Murray has completed 17 of 24 passes when targeting vertical routes this year, the highest rate in the league. What to know for fantasy: Last season, 49ers running backs racked up 98 fantasy points across their two games with the Cardinals. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: San Francisco is 8-2 ATS as a road underdog since the start of the 2019 season, while Arizona is 2-6 ATS as a home favorite under coach Kliff Kingsbury. Read more.",61.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: For as improved as the Cowboys have been defensively, big plays are still an issue. They have given up 21 plays of 20 yards or more through four games. The Giants have 16 plays of at least 20 yards and have a fully-loaded offense. Dallas has allowed five first downs this season on 3rd-and-10 or longer, so it will have to be mindful of New York QB Daniel Jones' ability to run and get the ball to receivers Kenny Golloday, Kadarius Toney and John Ross III, along with running back Saquon Barkley. -- Todd Archer Bold prediction: Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott will rush for 150-plus yards. Elliott rushed for 143 against a good Carolina defensive front last week, and now he gets to face a Giants defense that has struggled to stop the run this season. New York is 20th in the NFL in that area, allowing 122.8 yards per game on the ground, and they haven't faced an offensive line like Dallas' unit. -- Jordan Raanan Stat to know: Jones leads all NFL quarterbacks with a 71% completion percentage this season on passes that travel 15-plus yards downfield. What to know for fantasy: Cowboys QB Dak Prescott has a 75% completion percentage this season, second-best in the NFL. The Giants' defense has allowed the second-highest completion percentage, also at 75%. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: The Cowboys have won seven of their past eight games against the Giants, covering six of those contests. They are also the only team still unbeaten against the spread this season. Read more.",61.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Chiefs defended well against Buffalo QB Josh Allen and the Bills' offense in each of two games last season, but this is a different Kansas City defense, one with considerable weaknesses in many areas. The Bills are going to score some points. Can the Chiefs can outscore them? Kansas City scored a TD on every possession except one in last week's win over the Eagles, but Buffalo has the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense, so the task gets much more difficult this week. -- Adam Teicher Bold prediction: The Bills will score at least 35 points against the Chiefs. They have scored at least that many in each of the last three games, and that trend should continue in Kansas City. The Chiefs' defense ranks 31st in points per game allowed (31.3) and has struggled to limit opposing offenses. While Allen's start to the season has been inconsistent, he'll take advantage of the opportunity in primetime. -- Alaina Getzenberg Stat to know: Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes can become the third player in the NFL history with at least three touchdown passes in each of his first five games of a season (Steve Young in 1998 and Tom Brady in 2007). What to know for fantasy: Bills running back Zack Moss' carry count has increased each week this season, and he has found paydirt four times in those three games (did not play in Week 1). See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Kansas City is 0-3 ATS against teams with winning records this season. Read more.",69.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: All eyes will be on Colts quarterback Carson Wentz against the Ravens' pass rush. The last time Wentz played Baltimore, he was sacked six times (tied for the second-most in his career). The Ravens are coming off a game in which they recorded five sacks in Denver, and Indianapolis will again be without three-time All-Pro guard Quenton Nelson (sprained right ankle). -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson will pass for more than 300 yards. The Colts, like many teams, are focused on slowing down Baltimore's running game that has topped 100 yards on the ground in 43 straight games. Jackson had his first 300-yard passing game of the season (316) in Week 4 at Denver, and Colts coach Frank Reich said Jackson's passing ability is an ""underrated"" part of his game. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: After leading the league in first-down designed rush percentage over 2018-20, the Ravens are just 11th this season. What to know for fantasy: Since the beginning of 2019, the Ravens have won six primetime games. In those contests, Jackson is averaging 34 fantasy points, 94.5 rushing yards and more than a rushing score per game. See Week 5 rankings. Betting nugget: Home teams are 4-0 ATS on Monday Night Football this season. Read more.",45.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa is expected to return -- and under must-win stakes. If the Dolphins don't win at least two of their next three games, they'll be left with a record only one other team in modern NFL history has ever come back from to make the playoffs. So the pressure is on the second-year quarterback to resuscitate a stagnant offense (31st in yards per game and 30th in passing yards per game) in London. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence and Tagovailoa will each throw for more than 300 yards. Both teams' pass defenses rank in the bottom quarter of the league. They have allowed a combined 19 touchdown passes, have intercepted just three passes and are each giving up more than 280 passing yards per game. -- Mike DiRocco Stat to know: The Jaguars have not made a field goal this season. They are the first team since the 1962 Vikings to go without a field goal five games into a season, and the last team without a made field goal through six games was the 1956 Baltimore Colts. What to know for fantasy: Jacksonville running back James Robinson averages 19.2 fantasy points and 4.9 yards per carry for his career when getting at least 15 carries in a game, and he has at least 15 carries in three straight contests. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Favorites are 18-11 against the spread (ATS) in London games. But Miami has the worst cover margin in the NFL this season (minus-11.2) and lost outright the only other time it was favored this season. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" What to watch for: All eyes will be on the quarterbacks: the Chargers' Justin Herbert vs. the Ravens' Lamar Jackson. This is a clash of two of the NFL's best young quarterbacks who are at the top of their games right now. It's only the second matchup in league history in which both quarterbacks are coming off games of 400 total yards and four touchdown passes the prior week. Over the past three games, Herbert leads the NFL with 11 touchdown passes, while Jackson ranks second in the league with 1,045 yards passing. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: Herbert will throw for at least 400 yards, and Chargers running back Austin Ekeler will rush for at least 250. It's going to be that big of a day on offense. Herbert's poise and patience will be key against the Ravens' defense as he tries to keep a five-game streak of at least 25 completions alive. -- Shelley Smith Stat to know: The Chargers are allowing an NFL-high 157.6 rushing yards per game and 5.6 yards per rush this season. The Ravens, meanwhile, rank fourth in rushing yards per game (148.8) and sixth in yards per rush (4.9). What to know for fantasy: Ekeler is just the fifth player over the past 35 years to record 55 rushing yards and a receiving touchdown in three straight games, and his seven total touchdowns are tied for the NFL lead through five weeks. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: The over has hit in each of the past six games in which the Ravens had less than full rest, something that will be the case this week after Baltimore hosted Indianapolis on Monday night. Read more.",58.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Will Washington's defense be able to contain Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes? Washington ranks 27th in passing yards allowed per game, 22nd in yards per pass attempt allowed and tied for 31st in touchdowns allowed of 20 yards or more. The secondary has not been consistent, to say the least, and a coverage is blown each game. It would help if Washington's ground game takes over against a defense ranked 29th vs. the run -- it could lead to points and limit the Chiefs' time with the ball. -- John Keim Bold prediction: Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill will go over 100 yards and catch a couple of TD passes. It has been an unusual season for Hill, who has two big games with almost 200 yards and three games in which he wasn't much of a factor. But he'll bounce back after last week's poor showing against the Bills with a big game against Washington, which is allowing a generous opponent passer rating of 107.8. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: The Chiefs are allowing nearly 7.08 yards per play, which is the second-worst rate through five games in NFL history (1950 Baltimore Colts at 7.11), according to Elias Sports Bureau research. What to know for fantasy: Washington receiver Terry McLaurin caught 15 of 18 targets in the first two weeks this season but has hauled in just 14 of 31 targets since. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: The Chiefs were 7-3 ATS as a road favorite of 3-plus points in the first two years of the Mahomes era. Since then, they are just 3-5 ATS in such spots. Read more.",66.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Keep an eye on Carolina's offensive line. It has given up eight sacks and 19 quarterback hits the past two weeks, a big reason for a two-game losing streak. The Vikings rank second in the NFL in sacks with 17, so they can get after the QB. The Panthers likely will have back the left side of their line (tackle Cameron Erving and guard Pat Elflein), but even with them, teams were getting pressure on Sam Darnold. -- David Newton Bold prediction: Darnold will notch his seventh career game with three interceptions, which will be the most by any quarterback since he entered the NFL in 2018. The Vikings' pass rush ranks second with 3.4 sacks per game, and we saw how Darnold reverted back to his Jets form (i.e., holding on to the ball too long, making poor decisions) in Week 5 when he took blow after blow while facing pressure on 43% of his dropbacks. What Minnesota does up front will yield a big day on the back end of the defense in the form of multiple interceptions by the secondary. -- Courtney Cronin Stat to know: The Panthers' defense is allowing 4.75 yards per play -- only the Bills (4.25) are allowing fewer -- and is leading the NFL in pass rush win rate. What to know for fantasy: Minnesota quarterback Kirk Cousins is averaging 26.3 fantasy points per game over his past four on the road, averaging over 320 passing yards in the process with 11 scores and 0 interceptions. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Carolina is 4-1 ATS in its past five games when the line is between +3 and -3. Minnesota is 1-4 ATS in its past five in that spot. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Rams have allowed a league-low four sacks through five games, and only one team has produced fewer than the Giants' eight sacks. Can New York get near Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford? If not, it's going to be another long day for the Giants' defense and a good afternoon for Stafford and Los Angeles. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Stafford will pass for four touchdowns in a blowout win. The Giants' defense is allowing 27.8 points per game, which ranks 27th in the NFL, and it has given up 10 passing touchdowns, which ranks 21st. Stafford's connection has been just a bit off with receivers the past two games, so look for coach Sean McVay to dial up the passing game to get him in rhythm with his playmakers early. -- Lindsey Thiry Stat to know: The Rams lead the NFL this season in offensive efficiency (82.0) and yards per play (6.71). What to know for fantasy: Los Angeles running back Darrell Henderson has accounted for 72.9% of the Rams' RB touches in his four games this season. That's a higher rate than Dalvin Cook and Austin Ekeler hold this season with their respective teams. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Over the past five seasons, New York is 9-24-1 ATS at home and 7-18 ATS as a home underdog. Read more.",50.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Believe it or not, the Bears are within one game of the Packers in the NFC North. A victory over hated Green Bay would do wonders for Chicago's confidence. The Packers, meanwhile, are just hoping for business as usual. Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers (20-4 lifetime versus Chicago) has trounced the Bears throughout his illustrious career. -- Jeff Dickerson Bold prediction: Rodgers' turnover-free streak during the Packers' current four-game winning streak against the Bears will come to an end -- and it will cost them the game. Rodgers has 10 touchdown passes without a turnover in the past four meetings with Chicago, but the Bears' defense looks strong this season and could be the difference in pulling off an upset. -- Rob Demovsky Stat to know: Justin Fields will be the 20th different starting quarterback that the Bears have used against the Packers since 1992. The Packers have used only three different starting QBs vs. the Bears during that span. What to know for fantasy: Pass-happy game script? Packers receiver Davante Adams has scored or gone over 115 receiving yards in seven of his past eight games against the Bears, while running back Aaron Jones averages under 4.0 yards per carry for his career against Chicago, never totaling more than 90 total yards in a game in the process. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: The Packers have won nine of the past 10 meetings in this rivalry, covering the spread in seven of those instances. Read more.",44.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Will the Colts' pass rush have a big game against Houston's depleted offensive line? The Texans will be without their best offensive lineman, left tackle Laremy Tunsil (finger), against the Colts. That means an Indianapolis front led by DeForest Buckner will have an opportunity to put pressure on Houston rookie quarterback Davis Mills, who has been sacked 11 times in four games. And there's a chance the Colts could have rookie pass-rusher Kwity Paye (hamstring) back after he missed the past two games. -- Mike Wells Bold prediction: If Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton returns from injury (neck) and plays on Sunday, he'll continue his success against the Texans with a big game, reaching 100 receiving yards. In 18 career games against Houston, Hilton has 97 catches for 1,718 yards and 11 touchdowns. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: After throwing for 312 yards last week, Mills can become the first Texans rookie with 300-plus passing yards in consecutive weeks. What to know for fantasy: In each of the past five seasons, Hilton has had a game with over 19 fantasy points against Houston as Indianapolis' WR1. Michael Pittman Jr. has that role these days, and the Houston defense isn't exactly intimidating. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Indianapolis is 12-4-1 ATS against Houston since 2013.

" What to watch for: Although the Lions are one of two winless teams, this group could easily have two wins this year if it weren't for gut-wrenching losses to Baltimore and Minnesota on game-deciding field goals. So can they avoid starting 0-6 for the first time since 2008, when the squad infamously finished 0-16? (First-year Lions coach Dan Campbell actually experienced that as a player.) ""I know, I know. And look, nothing I'm going to tell them is going to make them feel any better,"" Campbell said to any disappointed fans. ""All I can do is try to prove it, show it -- not me, us, all of us, staff, players. Look, everybody is frustrated."" -- Eric Woodyard Bold prediction: Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase will have a 40-yard completion and 125 receiving yards. The Lions give up more yards per completion than any other team. With the Bengals' rushing attack a question mark because of injuries and COVID-19, Cincinnati could do some serious damage in the air. And so far, Chase has been the team's big-play receiver. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Joe Burrow is the first QB in Bengals history with multiple touchdown passes in each of the team's first five games. He seeks to join Dan Marino (1984) as the only first- or second-year quarterbacks with multiple passing touchdowns in their teams' first six games. What to know for fantasy: Chase is the second rookie WR with 450 receiving yards and five receiving TDs through five games. The other? Randy Moss in 1998. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Cincinnati is 1-4 ATS as a favorite under coach Zac Taylor (since 2019). Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: After giving up 47 points to the Chargers last weekend, how will the Browns' defense respond against Cardinals QB Kyler Murray and his array of talented skill players? It won't be easy to bounce back, especially with defensive ends Myles Garrett and Jadeveon Clowney and cornerback Denzel Ward limited in practice this week due to injuries. -- Jake Trotter Bold prediction: The Cardinals will hold the Browns' top-ranked rushing attack to under 100 yards in one of Arizona's best defensive efforts of the season. The Browns are averaging 187.6 yards per game on the ground, and the Cardinals are giving up 139 -- but the Cardinals have proved they can stop big-time rushing attacks. Just look at what they did in Week 1 to Tennessee's Derrick Henry, when they held him 58 yards and the Titans to 86. -- Josh Weinfuss Stat to know: Arizona receiver DeAndre Hopkins now has seven straight games without 100 yards receiving, his longest streak since 2016. He had a season-high 87 receiving yards last week. What to know for fantasy: Browns running back Kareem Hunt had eight rushing scores in his 24 games with the Browns prior to this season. He has five in five weeks this season. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: The Browns are 12-1 outright in their past 13 home games when not facing the Ravens. Read more.",63.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs knows Patriots QB Mac Jones well from their time together as teammates at Alabama. Diggs, a second-round pick in 2020, became only the second Cowboys defender to record an interception in each of the first five games of a season (Don Bishop, 1961). Jones, the Patriots' 2021 first-round pick, used to face Diggs in practice as Alabama's scout-team QB and already knows what it's like to be picked by him. ""He has a really good feel for the game,"" Jones said. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: The Patriots will score more than 21 points. That might not sound bold, but they have scored more than 21 points in just three of their past 11 home games -- and haven't reached the mark in any of their three home games this year. As improved as the Cowboys' defense is, it still gives up too many big plays, allowing 25 plays of 20 yards or more in five games. Dallas has lived on takeaways and offensive proficiency. The Patriots will have some chances, and Jones will put some points on the board. -- Todd Archer Stat to know: The Cowboys rank fifth in offensive efficiency and seventh in defensive efficiency this season. They are the only team in the league to rank in the top seven in both. What to know for fantasy: Dallas receiver Amari Cooper saw 17 targets and scored twice in Week 1. He has 18 targets and two scores in the four games since. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Dallas is the only team in the NFL that is still undefeated against the spread this season (5-0 ATS). It's the first team to start 5-0 ATS since 2018 Kansas City (7-0 ATS). Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: What will the Broncos' defense do against a Raiders offense in turmoil, and specifically quarterback Derek Carr? In Carr's past three trips to Denver, he has thrown for 288, 391 and 371 yards with four touchdowns across those three games. The Broncos' pass rush has been lukewarm over the past two games, and the group needs a big day in this one if the Broncos want to get a win they need. -- Jeff Legwold Bold prediction: Trying to compartmentalize the emotional roller coaster the Raiders have ridden this week is tough. So, too, will be keeping Denver edge rusher Von Miller in check, or have you missed Las Vegas' reimagined offensive line being unable to keep Carr clean? Carr is on pace to be sacked a career high-tying 51 times, and Miller -- who has 4.5 sacks this season -- will break through with at least two more against the Raiders. -- Paul Gutierrez Stat to know: Raiders running back Josh Jacobs is averaging 3.2 yards per rush this season, the third-lowest mark in the NFL among qualified running backs and ahead of only Mark Ingram II and James Conner. What to know for fantasy: Broncos running backs have had next to no success recently against the Raiders. Over the past five meetings, they've scored just once on 107 carries. And in the past three matchups, they've managed just 3.4 yards per carry. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Under tickets have cashed eight times in the past nine games between the Broncos and Raiders. Read more.",35.0,LOW
" What to watch for: No, the Steelers aren't facing Russell Wilson, but that doesn't mean they're taking the Seahawks' Geno Smith lightly. Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin stressed that Seattle can still run the same offense with him. The Steelers' defense looked better a week ago against the Broncos, in part because the offense sustained drives, but they have to replicate that again this week and make Smith uncomfortable by generating a stronger pass rush than they've managed in recent weeks. -- Brooke Pryor Bold prediction: Seattle's Gerald Everett and Will Dissly will combine for 100 receiving yards and a touchdown. Tight ends haven't factored into Seattle's passing game under new coordinator Shane Waldron as much as many expected, and that was the case even before Everett missed two games while on COVID-19/reserve. That could change with Smith replacing an injured Wilson. The prediction here is that Smith won't push the ball down the field as much as Wilson, opening up opportunities for Everett and Dissly on underneath routes. -- Brady Henderson Stat to know: The Seahawks have allowed 450 yards of offense in four straight games, which is tied for the longest streak in NFL history. What to know for fantasy: Over the past decade, four of the top nine prime-time fantasy performances from a running back have come from a rookie (Alfred Morris in 2012, David Johnson in 2015 and Kareem Hunt twice in 2017). Steelers running back Najee Harris has rushing touchdowns in consecutive games. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Smith is 5-0 ATS in his past five starts (his final four with the Jets and his only start with the Giants). Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: Something has to give. The Bills' defense is giving up 78.4 rushing yards per game, third best in the NFL. Tennessee's Derrick Henry is leading the league with 640 rushing yards and has four consecutive games with at least 100 yards on the ground. Henry had only 57 rushing yards in the Titans' 42-16 win over the Bills last season. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: The Bills will limit Henry to his second game this year under 100 rushing yards and give the Titans' offense some issues. This season under defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier, the Bills have adapted to defending whatever offense is thrown at them. So while the Titans are averaging 167.8 rush yards per game this season (third most in the NFL), only three teams are giving up fewer yards per rush than the Bills' 3.7. -- Alaina Getzenberg Stat to know: The Bills have scored 35-plus points in four straight games -- tied for the longest streak in franchise history. They could become the first team to score 35-plus points in five straight games since the Broncos in 2012-13. What to know for fantasy: Tennessee QB Ryan Tannehill's top four games as a member of the Titans have come at home, including a 30-point effort against these Bills in Week 5 of last season. See Week 6 rankings. Betting nugget: Buffalo has the best cover margin in the NFL (plus-15.3). That's the fourth-best mark by any team through five games in the past 20 seasons. Buffalo has covered four straight games, all by at least 15 points. Read more.",62.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Chiefs quarterback Mahomes is third in the NFL with five passing plays of 40 yards or more, and he's leading the NFL with 18 passing touchdowns. The Titans, meanwhile, have allowed six passing plays of 40 yards, third worst in the NFL. Tennessee's banged-up secondary has to find a way to keep the Chiefs' passing game from hitting the big play on Sunday. -- Turron Davenport Bold prediction: The Chiefs will hold Titans running back Derrick Henry to fewer than 100 rushing yards. Henry has had some big games against the Chiefs. He is off to a red-hot start, with 783 yards and 10 scores on the ground, and the Chiefs are allowing 5.2 yards per carry (No. 30 in the NFL). But the Kansas City defense may have finally found its footing in last week's game against Washington, and the expected return of defensive tackle Chris Jones (wrist) should help. -- Adam Teicher Stat to know: Titans receivers A.J. Brown and Julio Jones, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill all rank in the top 10 in yards per route among 83 players with at least 150 targets since 2019. Brown is sixth at 2.64, Jones is eighth at 2.56, Kelce is ninth at 2.50 and Hill is 10th at 2.48. What to know for fantasy: Kansas City running back Darrel Williams scored 23.9 fantasy points in his first start of the season in Week 6, a total that normal starter Clyde Edwards-Helaire (knee) has yet to hit this season. With 21 carries, the feature role is clearly his right now, and he has caught multiple passes in four straight games. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Kansas City is 4-13 against the spread (ATS) in its last 17 games, including the playoffs. It has not covered back-to-back games since Weeks 6-8 of last season, and it is 0-3 ATS against teams with winning records this season. Read more.",60.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow navigate the Ravens' defense? Burrow has thrown 14 touchdown passes, the second most by a Bengals quarterback through the first six games of a season. But he faces a different challenge in the Ravens, who held him to the lowest Total QBR (4.2) of his career last season. Burrow was pressured on a career-high 48.7% of his dropbacks and sacked seven times in his only meeting against Baltimore. -- Jamison Hensley Bold prediction: The Bengals will be limited to fewer than 300 offensive yards. Cincinnati's offense has gotten away with some inconsistency against lesser opponents, but there will be no room for error against Baltimore and defensive coordinator Don Martindale. -- Ben Baby Stat to know: Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson -- the NFL's only player with 1,500-plus passing yards and 300-plus rushing yards this season -- is 5-0 in his career against the Bengals, with an average margin of victory of 20.8 points per game. The Ravens won the past three games against the Bengals by a combined score of 114-19. What to know for fantasy: You know the rushing production is there for Bengals running back Joe Mixon (either a rushing touchdown or at least 5 yards per carry in each of his past four games), but the five catches last week in Detroit were noteworthy, too. He had four total catches in the four games prior. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Cincinnati games are 5-1 to the under this season, and all three of its road games have gone under the total. Read more.",47.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers and wide receiver Davante Adams are riding high. Rodgers has 12 touchdowns and one interception during the Packers' current five-game winning streak, and Adams has an NFL-best 668 receiving yards this season. Washington has allowed 186 points this season, its most through six games since 1998. It seems like a recipe for Rodgers and the Packers to roll. -- Rob Demovsky Bold prediction: Washington receiver Terry McLaurin will have his third 100-yard game of the season and score one touchdown, but Washington will be the first team this season that fails to score a TD when it enters the red zone against Green Bay. Cincinnati's Ja'Marr Chase is the only receiver to go over 100 against the Packers this season. -- John Keim Stat to know: The Packers are 16-2 at home in the regular season since Matt LaFleur became the coach in 2019 -- the best home record in the NFL in that span. What to know for fantasy: McLaurin hasn't finished better than WR45 in three of the past four weeks. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Washington is 1-5 ATS this season -- worst in the NFL -- including 0-3 ATS as an underdog. And under coach Ron Rivera, it is 0-4-1 ATS as an underdog of at least seven points. Read more.",54.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Panthers bring two dangerous edge rushers to this game with Haason Reddick (6.5 sacks) and Brian Burns (3.0). It's possible they wreck this game against Giants tackles Nate Solder and Matt Peart. Peart steps in after starting left tackle Andrew Thomas landed on injured reserve earlier this week. Solder has a below-average pass block win rate of 82.8% while Peart is at 81.0%. These matchups should dictate whether the Giants can produce any offense. -- Jordan Raanan Bold prediction: Panthers rookie running back Chuba Hubbard will rush for 150 yards and two touchdowns. Carolina coach Matt Rhule promised a vastly different look on offense and more of a lean on the run, and the Giants' defense is ranked 25th in the NFL (4.5 yards per carry allowed) against the run. -- David Newton Stat to know: Over the past three games (all losses), the Panthers have allowed 30.3 points per game, 27th in the NFL. They allowed 10.0 per game in their first three games, the second fewest league-wide. What to know for fantasy: Hubbard is locked into a fantasy-friendly role with Christian McCaffrey on IR, but be careful. Here are Hubbard's yards per carry over the past four weeks: 4.7, 4.4, 4.2 and 3.8. Last week, against the Vikings, none of his 16 carries gained more than nine yards. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: New York is 0-3 ATS at home this season, and quarterback Daniel Jones is 4-11 ATS at home in his career. Read more.",33.5,LOW
" What to watch for: The Patriots intercepted Jets quarterback Zach Wilson four times in the Week 2 meeting between these teams, and several of those were gift-wrapped by the No. 2 overall pick. Will history repeat itself? The Patriots have just two interceptions in their other five games and a minus-3 turnover differential on the season. -- Mike Reiss Bold prediction: A first-quarter pick-six by safety Marcus Maye will kill two slumps with one stone, so to speak. It will be the Jets' first interception in eight games, dating to last season, and their first score of the season in the opening quarter. The Jets have been outscored 30-0 in the first quarter and 75-13 in first half this season. But they'll still find a way to lose the game. -- Rich Cimini Stat to know: New England receiver Jakobi Meyers has 121 career receptions but zero receiving touchdowns. No other wide receiver to debut in the past 40 seasons has had more than 100 receptions before his first career TD reception, per the Elias Sports Bureau. What to know for fantasy: There were just five players who ran for a score and saw three targets in both Weeks 4 and 5. Four of those names won't surprise you: Jonathan Taylor, Kareem Hunt, Austin Ekeler and Najee Harris. Jets rookie running back Michael Carter is the fifth. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: New England is 0-4 outright and 1-3 ATS at home this season, including two outright losses as a favorite. Read more.",43.5,LOW
" What to watch for: Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has never thrown for 300 yards in consecutive games in his NFL career and faces a Falcons defense that has yet to allow a 300-yard passer this season. Tagovailoa has also never thrown for three touchdowns in a single game, but Atlanta has allowed three of its five opponents to do this season. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Bold prediction: Falcons receiver Calvin Ridley will have his first 100-yard game of the year and score two touchdowns to get his season back on track. During joint practices with the Dolphins in August, Ridley dominated on the field. On Sunday, he'll do more of the same, no matter who is lined up against him. -- Michael Rothstein Stat to know: Atlanta tight end Kyle Pitts (308) and Miami receiver Jaylen Waddle (301) are Nos. 4 and 5 in receiving yards among rookies this season. What to know for fantasy: After not finishing as a top-15 tight end in consecutive weeks, Pitts was the TE3 in Week 5 against the Jets. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Miami is the fifth team to not have a bye following a London game. The previous four (two in 2016 and two in 2017) went 2-2 both straight up and ATS. Read more.",53.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Sunday's matchup marks an intriguing pair of reunions. Rams coach Sean McVay will face off against Goff, his former quarterback of four seasons who admitted this week that he remains sour about how last January's blockbuster trade that sent him to Detroit in exchange for Lions quarterback Stafford went down. And while McVay and Goff will face each other for the first time, Stafford will also for the first time face his former team, which he requested a trade from after 12 seasons. -- Lindsey Thiry Bold prediction: Goff will pass for 300-plus yards. Although he has had just one such game this season, he will bring his A-game against his old team while trying to be as accurate as possible. Going against his former teammates Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey is a tough task, but he knows their tendencies. -- Eric Woodyard Stat to know: Stafford's 16 touchdown passes this season are the most in NFL history in a player's first six games with a team. What to know for fantasy: The NFC has seen a QB throw over 25 passes and average 0.85 fantasy points per pass in a game five times this season, and Stafford is responsible for two of them (Weeks 1 and 6). See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Double-digit favorites are 8-0 outright and 6-2 ATS this season. Read more.",52.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: How will the Raiders compartmentalize their emotions against an Eagles team that last played 10 days ago? Las Vegas ran the gamut in an emotional week that included the resignation of coach Jon Gruden after his email scandal and ended with its most impressive all-around game in recent memory. The Eagles are well-rested, and with another quarterback who can extend plays in Jalen Hurts, the Raiders defense will again be put to the test. -- Paul Gutierrez Bold prediction: Hurts will become the first QB to rush for two touchdowns in three straight games since 1950. The Raiders rank 26th against the run (4.6 yards per carry allowed), and Hurts will take advantage to help get the Eagles' season back on track. He's tied for most quarterback rushing TDs (five) entering Week 7 while leading his team in rushing yards (300). -- Tim McManus Stat to know: Las Vegas quarterback Derek Carr is 54 passing yards shy of 2,000. The most by a Raiders QB through seven games is 2,382 (Rich Gannon in 2002). What to know for fantasy: Hurts has thrown just five touchdown passes over the past five weeks, and yet he is the only quarterback in the NFL who has been a top-12 option at the position every week this season. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Nine of Las Vegas' 11 home games at Allegiant Stadium have gone over the total since it opened last season. Read more.",53.5,HIGH
" What to watch for: The Bucs have survived a rash of injuries -- particularly among their defensive backs -- and penalties to get to 5-1. But if you look closely at those wins, only one has come against a top-10 defense -- the Patriots -- and that was by the skin of their teeth against a rookie quarterback. So this may be closer than expected, but look for the Bucs' pass-rush to continue to be the difference-maker against Chicago QB Justin Fields and a Bears offensive line that has surrendered a league-high 22 sacks this year. -- Jenna Laine Bold prediction: Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady will commit three turnovers -- and Tampa will still win easily. The Bears can get after it on defense, where they lead the NFL in sacks. Not having pass-rusher Robert Quinn (Reserve/COVID-19 list) hurts, but Chicago has enough playmakers on D to rattle Brady. The problem is the Bears cannot score points to capitalize on those takeaways. -- Jeff Dickerson Stat to know: Brady and Bucs receiver Antonio Brown have connected for 10 touchdowns since Week 15 of last season. That's the most by any QB-receiver duo in the NFL over that span. What to know for fantasy: A single player has accounted for 100% of his team's backfield touches five times this season: Harris (Week 1), David Montgomery (Week 3), Alvin Kamara (Week 5), James Robinson (Week 6) and ... Chicago's Khalil Herbert (Week 6). See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Unders are 5-1 in Chicago games this season, tied for the best under mark this season (Bengals and Chargers). But all three Tampa Bay home games have gone over the total this season. Read more.",44.0,LOW
" What to watch for: It's not a homecoming because it's in Arizona, but it'll be the first time that Cardinals receiver DeAndre Hopkins and defensive lineman J.J. Watt will face the only other team they played for in their careers. That means there'll be plenty of emotion, regardless of what they say publicly. How they'll handle it and whether the emotion affects their play will be the big question Sunday. -- Josh Weinfuss Bold prediction: Watt will score a touchdown. This game against the team he spent his first 10 seasons playing for is probably one Watt has had circled on the calendar since the schedule came out. Watt has six career touchdowns -- including three on offense -- and he'll add to it on Sunday against the Texans. -- Sarah Barshop Stat to know: Hopkins has six receiving touchdowns so far and is seeking to join Anquan Boldin (seven, 2008) as the only Cardinals in the Super Bowl era with seven in their first seven games of a season. But Hopkins has also been held under 100 receiving yards in eight straight games, the third-longest such streak of his career and his longest since 13 straight in the 2016 season. What to know for fantasy: Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray's yards per carry have been cut in half from last season, but he ranks second among qualifiers (minimum 150 pass attempts) in fantasy points per pass (0.60, behind only Stafford). See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: Arizona is 5-1 ATS this season, tied for the second-best mark in the league. Arizona has covered four straight games -- but it has not been a double-digit favorite since 2016. Read more.",48.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Storylines abound here, with the North Dakota State quarterbacks on opposite sidelines, Colts defensive tackle DeForest Buckner's return to San Francisco and more. But the thing that will decide this game is the thing that decides most games: turnovers. The 49ers are minus-5 in turnover differential, tied for third-worst in the NFL, while the Colts are plus-7, which is tied for third-best. Both teams badly need a win here, and the turnover battle should go a long way in determining who gets it. -- Nick Wagoner Bold prediction: Buckner will match his season total in sacks with two. He said it's ""a little personal"" playing against the team that drafted him and where he spent the first four years of his NFL career before being traded to the Colts in March 2020. Buckner has had least two sacks in a game eight times in his career. -- Mike Wells Stat to know: The Colts have a 42.9% red zone efficiency, which is the second-worst in the NFL (nine of 21 red zone drives ended in a touchdown). What to know for fantasy: Indianapolis running back Taylor was RB28 in the first three weeks of the season. Since then, he's RB2. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan is 8-19-2 ATS as a favorite. San Francisco is 2-7 outright in its last nine games as a favorite of at least three points, including 2-2 this year with back-to-back losses. Read more.",52.0,HIGH
" What to watch for: Can Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith keep Seattle from falling into a probably-insurmountable 2-5 hole? This is pretty much a must-win game for the Seahawks, who are already four games back in the NFC West and will be without Russell Wilson for at least one more game after this one. Smith played well enough in the second half last week to give the Seahawks a chance to win before losing a fumble in overtime on a T.J. Watt strip sack. Against New Orleans, he won't face as strong a pass-rush or as dominant a defender. -- Brady Henderson Bold prediction: After the Seahawks ran for a season-high 144 yards last week, they will run for a season-low total and fall short of 50 on Monday night. Not only is Seattle's backfield banged up right now, but the Saints' run defense has been among the NFL's best over the past four years. And they will be extra motivated to shut down that element of Seattle's game to force Smith to move the ball. -- Mike Triplett Stat to know: The Seahawks are allowing 433.2 yards per game this season, worst in the NFL. They have allowed 100 rushing yards in six straight games (tied for their longest streak since 2011). What to know for fantasy: During the first four weeks of the season, Saints running back Kamara was averaging an underwhelming 3.5 targets per game. Prior to going on bye in Week 6, the old Kamara reminded us of his potential as a pass-catcher, as he hauled in five of eight targets for 51 yards and a touchdown against Washington. See Week 7 rankings. Betting nugget: New Orleans has covered nine of its last 12 games following a bye. Read more.",46.0,LOW
